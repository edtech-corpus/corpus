  	             (3)  "Operator" means, to the extent operating in this
  	capacity, the operator of a website, online service, online

  	student at an online location based on the student's visit to that
  	location at that time, or in response to the student's request for

  	online activities or requests over time for the purpose of
  	targeting subsequent advertisements.
  	       Sec. 32.152.  PROHIBITED USE OF COVERED INFORMATION. (a) An
  	operator may not knowingly:
  	             (1)  engage in targeted advertising on any website,

  	online service, online application, or mobile application for a
  	school purpose;
  	             (2)  use information, including persistent unique

  	any student's covered information.
  	       (b)  For purposes of Subsection (a)(2), the collection and

  	             (1)  the purchase, merger, or any other type of
  	acquisition of an operator by another entity, if the operator or
  	successor entity complies with this subchapter regarding
  	previously acquired student information; or
  	             (2)  a national assessment provider if the provider
  	secures the express affirmative consent of the student or the

  	notice, and if the information is used solely to provide access to
  	employment, educational scholarships, financial aid, or
  	postsecondary educational opportunities.

  	conspicuous notice, use or disclose covered information solely to
  	provide access to employment, educational scholarships, financial
  	aid, or postsecondary educational opportunities.
  	       (c)  An operator may disclose covered information if a

  	the information. The operator must comply with the requirements of
  	federal and state law to protect the information being disclosed.
  	       (d)  An operator may disclose covered information to a third
  	party if the operator has contracted with the third party to provide

  	information for any purpose other than providing the contracted
  	service. The operator must require the third party to implement and
  	maintain reasonable procedures and practices designed to prevent
  	disclosure of covered information.
  	       (e)  Nothing in this subchapter prohibits the operator's use

  	             (4)  responding to a student's request for information
  	or for feedback without the information or response being
  	determined by payment or other consideration from a third party; or

  	operator, the operator shall delete the information not later than

  	specified in the contract or terms of service, unless the student or
  	the student's parent consents to the operator's maintenance of the
  	covered information.
  	       Sec. 32.157.  APPLICABILITY. This subchapter does not:
