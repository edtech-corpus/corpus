S.B. 1450 
 
 
 
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona: 

Section 1.  Section  15-142,  Arizona  Revised  Statutes,  is  amended  to 

read: 

15-142.  Access to directory information relating to pupils and 
to school property; violation; withholding of state 
aid 

A.  If the governing board of a school district or the governing body 
of a charter school permits the release of directory information relating to 
pupils or permits access to school buildings, school grounds or other school 
property  to  persons  who  inform  pupils  of  educational  or  occupational 
opportunities, the governing board or governing body shall provide access to 
directory information relating to pupils and to school property on the same 
basis for official recruiting representatives of the militia of this state 
and  the  armed  services  of  the  United  States  for  the  purpose  of  informing 
pupils of educational and occupational opportunities available in the militia 
and the armed services.  If the school district or charter school permits the 
release of directory information relating to pupils, the information shall be 
released on or before October 31 of each year.  The department of education 
shall design and provide to school districts and charter schools a form to 
allow pupils to request that directory information not be released pursuant 
to the elementary and secondary education act as reauthorized by the no child 
left  behind  act  of  2001.  School  districts  and  charter  schools  shall 
distribute the form to pupils each year separate from any other form.  If a 
school district or charter school distributes materials to pupils through 
electronic  communication  or  on  an  internet  website,  the  form  may  be 
distributed in the same manner.  A person who is wrongfully denied access to 
directory information or access to school buildings, school grounds or other 
school property may notify the department of education, which shall report 
the alleged violation to the United States department of education. 

B.  Notwithstanding  subsection  A  OF  THIS  SECTION,  pupil  transcripts 
shall not be released to representatives of postsecondary institutions, the 
militia of this state or the armed services of the United States unless the 
pupil  consents  in  writing  to  the  release  of  the  pupil's  transcript.  The 
governing board of the school district or the governing body of the charter 
school shall provide the pupil with a transcript release form that allows the 
pupil to designate in separate check boxes whether the transcript is to be 
released  to  postsecondary  institutions,  the  militia  of  this  state  or  the 
armed services of the United States, or to any combination of these entities. 
C.  This section shall not be construed to authorize school districts 
or  charter  schools  to  release  information  that  would  violate  the  family 
educational rights and privacy act of 1974 (20 United States Code section 
1232g).  ANY PERSON WHO SUSPECTS THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CHARTER SCHOOL HAS 
VIOLATED  THE  FAMILY  EDUCATIONAL  RIGHTS  AND  PRIVACY  ACT  MAY  NOTIFY  THE 
PRINCIPAL OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL OR THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
IF  THE  MATTER  IS  NOT  SATISFACTORILY  RESOLVED  WITHIN  SIXTY  DAYS  AFTER  THE

NOTICE, THE PERSON MAY FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION OR 
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.  IF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION OR 
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION DETERMINES THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR 
CHARTER SCHOOL IS IN VIOLATION OF THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY 
ACT, THE STATE BOARD OR SUPERINTENDENT SHALL NOTIFY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR 
CHARTER SCHOOL THAT IT IS IN VIOLATION OF THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND 
PRIVACY ACT.  IF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION OR THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC 
INSTRUCTION DETERMINES THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CHARTER SCHOOL HAS FAILED 
TO CORRECT THE VIOLATION WITHIN SIXTY DAYS AFTER A NOTICE HAS BEEN ISSUED 
PURSUANT TO THIS SUBSECTION, THE STATE BOARD OR SUPERINTENDENT MAY DIRECT THE 
DEPARTMENT  OF  EDUCATION  TO  WITHHOLD  UP  TO  TEN  PER  CENT  OF  THE  MONTHLY 
APPORTIONMENT OF STATE AID THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE DUE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR 
CHARTER  SCHOOL.  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  EDUCATION  SHALL  ADJUST  THE  SCHOOL 
DISTRICT'S  OR  CHARTER  SCHOOL'S  APPORTIONMENT  ACCORDINGLY.  WHEN  THE  STATE 
BOARD OF EDUCATION OR THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION DETERMINES 
THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CHARTER SCHOOL HAS CORRECTED THE VIOLATION AND IS 
IN  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE  FAMILY  EDUCATIONAL  RIGHTS  AND  PRIVACY  ACT,  THE 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SHALL RESTORE THE FULL AMOUNT OF STATE AID PAYMENTS 
TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CHARTER SCHOOL.
