    13  follows:
    14    4.  Total  foundation  aid.    In  addition to any other apportionment

    15  pursuant to this chapter, a school district, other than  a  special  act
    16  school district as defined in subdivision eight of section four thousand
    17  one of this chapter, shall be eligible for total foundation aid equal to
    18  the  product  of  total aidable foundation pupil units multiplied by the
    19  district's selected foundation aid, which shall be the greater  of  five
    20  hundred dollars ($500) or foundation formula aid, provided, however that
    21  for  the  two  thousand  seven--two  thousand eight through two thousand
    22  eight--two thousand nine school years, no school district shall  receive
    23  total  foundation  aid  in excess of the sum of the total foundation aid
    24  base for aid payable in  the  two  thousand  seven--two  thousand  eight
    25  school  year  computed  pursuant  to  subparagraph (i) of paragraph j of
    26  subdivision one of this section, plus the phase-in  foundation  increase

    27  computed  pursuant  to  paragraph  b  of  this subdivision, and provided
    28  further that for the two thousand twelve--two thousand  thirteen  school

    36  total  foundation  aid  in excess of the sum of the total foundation aid
    37  base computed pursuant  to  paragraph  j  of  subdivision  one  of  this
    38  section,  plus  the  phase-in  foundation  increase computed pursuant to

    39  paragraph b of this subdivision and provided further that total  founda-
    40  tion  aid shall not be less than the product of the total foundation aid
    41  base computed pursuant to paragraph j of subdivision one of this section
    42  and the due-minimum percent which shall be, for the two thousand twelve-

     1  school district shall receive total foundation aid in an amount equal to
     2  the amount apportioned to such school  district  for  the  two  thousand
     3  eight--two thousand nine school year pursuant to this subdivision. Total
     4  aidable foundation pupil units shall be calculated pursuant to paragraph

     5  g  of  subdivision  two of this section. For the purposes of calculating
     6  aid pursuant to this subdivision, aid for the city  school  district  of
     7  the city of New York shall be calculated on a citywide basis.
     8    a.  Foundation  formula  aid.  Foundation  formula aid shall equal the
     9  remainder when the expected minimum  local  contribution  is  subtracted
    10  from  the product of the foundation amount, the regional cost index, and

    16  general education in successful  school  districts,  provided  that  the

    17  foundation  amount  shall be adjusted annually to reflect the percentage
    18  increase in the consumer price index as computed pursuant to section two
    19  thousand twenty-two of this chapter, provided that for the two  thousand
    20  eight--two  thousand  nine  school year, for the purpose of such adjust-
    21  ment, the percentage increase in  the  consumer  price  index  shall  be
    22  deemed  to  be two and nine-tenths percent (0.029), and provided further
    23  that the foundation amount for  the  two  thousand  seven--two  thousand
    24  eight  school  year  shall  be  five  thousand  two  hundred fifty-eight
    25  dollars, and provided further that for the two thousand seven--two thou-
    26  sand eight through two thousand  fifteen--two  thousand  sixteen  school
    27  years,  the  foundation amount shall be further adjusted by the phase-in
    28  foundation percent established pursuant to paragraph b of this  subdivi-
    29  sion.

    30    (2)  The regional cost index shall reflect an analysis of labor market
    31  costs based on median salaries in professional occupations that  require
    32  similar  credentials  to  those of positions in the education field, but
    33  not including those occupations in the education  field,  provided  that
    34  the regional cost indices for the two thousand seven--two thousand eight
    35  school year and thereafter shall be as follows:
    36            Labor Force Region  Index

    47  dinary needs percent, provided, however, that the pupil need index shall
    48  not be less than one nor more than two. The extraordinary needs  percent
    49  shall  be  calculated pursuant to paragraph w of subdivision one of this
    50  section.
    51    (4) The expected minimum local contribution shall equal the lesser  of
    52  (i)  the product of (A) the quotient arrived at when the selected actual
    53  valuation is divided by total wealth foundation pupil units,  multiplied
    54  by  (B)  the  product  of the local tax factor, multiplied by the income

     4  four  decimal  places  without rounding, of ninety percent multiplied by
     5  the quotient of the sum of the statewide average tax rate as computed by
     6  the commissioner for the current year in accordance with the  provisions
     7  of  paragraph  e of subdivision one of section thirty-six hundred nine-e
     8  of this part plus the statewide average tax rate computed by the commis-

    23  thousand nine school year, and provided further that such income  wealth
    24  index  shall  not  be  less than zero for the two thousand thirteen--two
    25  thousand fourteen school year. The selected actual  valuation  shall  be

    26  calculated  pursuant  to paragraph c of subdivision one of this section.
    27  Total wealth foundation pupil units  shall  be  calculated  pursuant  to

     1    b. Such grants shall be awarded to school districts, within the limits
     2  of funds appropriated therefor, through a competitive process that takes
     3  into  consideration  the  magnitude  of  any shortage of teachers in the

    26  section  21  of  part A of chapter 57 of the laws of 2013, is amended to
    27  read as follows:
    28    6. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the  contrary,
    29  the  board  of  education of a city school district with a population of

    30  one hundred twenty-five thousand or more inhabitants shall be  permitted
    31  to  establish  maximum  class  sizes  for  special  classes  for certain
    32  students with disabilities in accordance with  the  provisions  of  this
    33  subdivision. For the purpose of obtaining relief from any adverse fiscal
    34  impact  from under-utilization of special education resources due to low
    35  student attendance in  special  education  classes  at  the  middle  and
    36  secondary level as determined by the commissioner, such boards of educa-
    37  tion  shall, during the school years nineteen hundred ninety-five--nine-
    38  ty-six through June thirtieth, two thousand [<B><S>fourteen</S></B>]  <B><U>fifteen</U></B>  of  the

    40  year,  be authorized to increase class sizes in special classes contain-

    41  ing students with disabilities whose age ranges are equivalent to  those
    42  of  students  in  middle and secondary schools as defined by the commis-
    43  sioner for purposes of this section by up to but not to exceed  one  and
    44  two  tenths  times  the applicable maximum class size specified in regu-
    45  lations of the commissioner rounded up  to  the  nearest  whole  number,
    46  provided  that  in  a  city  school  district having a population of one
    47  million or more, classes that have a maximum class size of  fifteen  may
    48  be increased by no more than one student and provided that the projected
    49  average  class size shall not exceed the maximum specified in the appli-
    50  cable regulation, provided that such authorization  shall  terminate  on
    51  June  thirtieth,  two thousand. Such authorization shall be granted upon
    52  filing of a notice by such a board of education  with  the  commissioner

    53  stating the board's intention to increase such class sizes and a certif-
    54  ication  that  the  board will conduct a study of attendance problems at
    55  the secondary level and will  implement  a  corrective  action  plan  to
    56  increase  the rate of attendance of students in such classes to at least

     1  the rate for students attending regular education classes  in  secondary
     2  schools  of the district. Such corrective action plan shall be submitted
     3  for approval by the commissioner by a date during  the  school  year  in
     4  which  such  board  increases  class  sizes as provided pursuant to this
     5  subdivision to be prescribed by the commissioner. Upon at  least  thirty
     6  days  notice  to  the board of education, after conclusion of the school

     7  year in which such board increases class sizes as provided  pursuant  to
     8  this subdivision, the commissioner shall be authorized to terminate such
     9  authorization  upon  a  finding  that the board has failed to develop or
    10  implement an approved corrective action plan.
    11    &#167; 9-a. Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, for a
    12  school district with a penalty arising from the late filing of  a  final
    13  cost  report  pursuant to section 31 of part A of chapter 57 of the laws
    14  of 2012 where such penalty exceeds $6,000,000 and also exceeds 5 percent
    15  of such district's total  general  fund  expenditures  for  the  2011-12
    16  school year, the commissioner of education shall recover such penalty in
    17  five equal annual installments beginning the later of June, 2016 or June
    18  of  the  school  year in which such district is notified of the penalty.

    19  Provided further that such district may elect to make an initial payment
    20  no later than thirty days in advance of  the  first  annual  installment
    21  which shall reduce the amount of each annual installment.
    22    &#167;  10.  Legislative findings and determinations. The legislature finds
    23  that charter schools are public schools and, like school districts, part
    24  of the public school system that discharges the  state's  constitutional
    25  duty  to  provide  for  the  maintenance and support of a system of free
    26  common schools. The legislature further finds that charter schools oper-
    27  ate primarily with public moneys derived from  the  federal  government,
    28  the  state and local school districts. Therefore, the legislature deter-
    29  mines that the manner in which charter schools conduct  their  financial
    30  operations implicates the fiscal concerns of the state.

    31    Moreover,  the  legislature  finds that as the chief fiscal officer of
    32  New York city, the city comptroller has a  duty  to  manage  the  fiscal
    33  affairs  of  such city and that a fundamental constitutional duty of the
    34  state comptroller is to superintend the fiscal concerns  of  the  state.
    35  The  legislature further finds that audits of charter schools' financial
    36  operations are not only necessary to protect New  York  city's  and  the
    37  rest  of  the state's fiscal concerns, but are uniquely within the comp-
    38  trollers' expertise as the city's  and  state's  chief  fiscal  officer.
    39  Therefore,  the  legislature  determines that the state has a compelling
    40  interest in having the city and state comptrollers audit  the  financial
    41  operations of charter schools throughout the state.
    42    &#167;  10-a.  Paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of section 2853 of the educa-

    43  tion law, as added by chapter 4 of the laws of 1998, is amended to  read
    44  as follows:

    22  is amended to read as follows:
