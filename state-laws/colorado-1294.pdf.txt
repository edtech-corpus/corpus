CONCERNING  STUDENT  DATA  COLLECTION  PRIVACY  PROTECTIONS

ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

 

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:

SECTION 1.  Legislative declaration. (1)  The general assembly
hereby finds and declares that the privacy of Colorado citizens is of the
utmost importance, and protecting their privacy is a top priority for the
lawmakers of this state. The notion of privacy has vastly changed with
technological  advancement,  developments  such  as  "the  cloud",  and  the
exponential growth of social media popularity. Although this has changed
the  public  perception  of  privacy,  it  remains  imperative  that  personal
information  stay  confidential  unless  otherwise  chosen  on  an  individual
basis.  The  privacy  of  our  children  is  critically  important,  especially  in
regard to their K-12 educational experience and the student data collected
during  this  time.  Schools  are  a  safe  environment,  and  an  important

________

deletions from existing statutes and such material not part of act.

component  of  maintaining  security  is  ensuring  student  privacy  and
protecting student data. Despite the importance of protecting the privacy of
our children, Colorado law is not currently clear on how student data is to
be handled. As such, transparency in data collection and security is crucial.
It is critical that parents have the opportunity to understand how student
data is collected, where the data is stored, and how and why the data is
utilized.

(2)  For this reason, the general assembly finds that it is the duty of
the Colorado department of education to publish an index of utilized data
elements as well as privacy policies regarding accessibility to the data and
notices of student and parent rights.

(3)  Furthermore, the general assembly finds that the department of
education must have a detailed data security plan regarding the protection
and confidentiality of all Colorado student data, whether the data is stored
inside or outside the state, and must create a data security  template for
school districts to use to create their own data security plans.

SECTION  2.    In  Colorado  Revised  Statutes,  add  22-2-309  as

follows:

22-2-309.    Student  data  -  accessibility  -  transparency  -
accountability - definitions. (1)  THIS SECTION SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY
BE  CITED  AS  THE  "STUDENT  DATA  PROTECTION,  ACCESSIBILITY,
TRANSPARENCY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2014".

REQUIRES:

(a)  "AGGREGATE DATA" MEANS DATA COLLECTED AND REPORTED

AT THE GROUP, COHORT, OR INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL.

(b)  "DATA SYSTEM" MEANS THE COLORADO STATE DEPARTMENT OF
