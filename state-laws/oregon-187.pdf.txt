CHAPTER .................................................

AN  ACT

Relating  to  student  privacy;  creating  new  provisions;  amending  ORS  646.607;  and  prescribing  an  ef-

fective  date.
Whereas  some  Internet  websites,  online  services,  online  applications  and  mobile  applications
that  are  designed  and  used  for  kindergarten  through  grade  12  purposes  involve  gathering  identifi-
able  private  information  of  students,  many  of  whom  are  too  young  to  understand  the  significance
of  being  asked  to  share  personal  information;  and

Whereas  this  vulnerable  population  will  be  better  protected  by  the  development  of standards for
operators  of  Internet  websites,  online  services,  online  applications  or  mobile  applications  that  have
actual  knowledge  that  their  sites,  services  or  applications  are  used  primarily  for  kindergarten
through  grade  12  purposes  and  that  their  sites,  services  or  applications  were designed and marketed
for  kindergarten  through  grade  12  school  purposes;  now,  therefore,
