and to assure educational excellence in each classroom in the state's public schools; and

regarding recruitment, preservice, licensure, induction, professional development, and

evaluation is essential if the state and its citizens expect every classroom to be staffed by a

skilled, caring, and effective teacher.

(b)  In providing for the safe and effective performance of the function of educating

Utah's children, the Legislature further finds it to be of critical importance that education,

School Program for each year is the total of the units for each school district and, subject to

Subsection (4), charter school, determined as follows:

(1)  The number of units is computed by adding the average daily membership of all

pupils of the school district or charter school attending schools, other than kindergarten and

self-contained classes for children with a disability.

(2)  The number of units is computed by adding the average daily membership of all

pupils of the school district or charter school enrolled in kindergarten and multiplying the total

by .55.

(a)  In those school districts or charter schools that do not hold kindergarten for a full

nine-month term, the local school board or charter school governing board may approve a

shorter term of nine weeks' duration.

(b)  Upon [local education] LEA governing board approval, the number of pupils in

average daily membership at the short-term kindergarten shall be counted for the purpose of

determining the number of units allowed in the same ratio as the number of days the short-term

kindergarten is held, not exceeding nine weeks, compared to the total number of days schools

are held in that school district or charter school in the regular school year.

(3) (a)  The [State Board of Education] state board shall use prior year plus growth to

determine average daily membership in distributing money under the [minimum school

program] Minimum School Program where the distribution is based on kindergarten through

grade 12 ADMs or weighted pupil units.

(b)  Under prior year plus growth, kindergarten through grade 12 average daily

5846 membership for the current year is based on the actual kindergarten through grade 12 average

daily membership for the previous year plus an estimated percentage growth factor.

(c)  The growth factor is the percentage increase in total average daily membership on

the first school day of October in the current year as compared to the total average daily

5850 membership on the first school day of October of the previous year.

(4)  In distributing funds to charter schools under this section, charter school pupils

shall be weighted, where applicable, as follows:

(a)  .55 for kindergarten pupils;

(b)  .9 for pupils in grades 1 through 6;

(c)  .99 for pupils in grades 7 through 8; and
