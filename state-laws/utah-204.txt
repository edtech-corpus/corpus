240          (i) maintain and publish a list of state assessments, state assessment systems, and
241     software that qualify under Subsection (9)(a); and
242          (ii) audit and verify an LEA's compliance with the requirements of this Subsection (9).
243          (10) (a) An LEA shall provide for:
