	LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST


   AB 2828, as introduced, Chau. Personal information: privacy:
breach.
   Existing law requires a person or business conducting business in
California and any agency, as defined, that owns or licenses
computerized data that includes personal information, as defined, to
disclose a breach in the security of the data to a resident of
California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is
reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person
in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,
as specified.
   This bill would also require a person or business conducting
business in California, and any agency, that owns or licenses
computerized data that includes personal information to disclose a
breach of the security of the data to a resident of California whose
encrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have
been, acquired by an unauthorized person if the encryption key or
security credential, as defined, has, or is reasonably believed to
have been, acquired by an unauthorized person at any time before or
after the breach of security of the data.
   Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes.
State-mandated local program: no.

whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed
to have been, acquired by an unauthorized <strike> person. </strike>
<em> person, or, if the encryption key or security credential has,

conspicuous notice delivered to the resident online when the resident
is connected to the online account from an Internet Protocol address
or online location from which the agency knows the resident
customarily accesses the account.
   (j) Notwithstanding subdivision (i), an agency that maintains its
own notification procedures as part of an information security policy
for the treatment of personal information and is otherwise
consistent with the timing requirements of this part shall be deemed
to be in compliance with the notification requirements of this
section if it notifies subject persons in accordance with its

an unauthorized person. </em> The disclosure shall be made in the
most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,
consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, as provided
in subdivision (c), or any measures necessary to determine the scope
of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data
system.
   (b) A person or business that maintains computerized data that
