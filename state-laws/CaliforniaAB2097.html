	AMENDED IN ASSEMBLY  MARCH 18, 2016

INTRODUCED BY   Assembly Members Melendez, Gonzalez, and Gatto

                        FEBRUARY 17, 2016

   An act to amend Section <strike> 52372 of </strike> <em> 56601 of,
and to add Section 49076.7 to, </em> the Education Code, relating to
<strike> career technical education. </strike> <em> pupil records.
</em>



	LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST


   AB 2097, as amended, Melendez. <strike> Career technical
education. </strike> <em> Pupil records: </em> <em> social security
numbers. </em> <em>
   Existing law authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction,
in order to assist the state in evaluating the effectiveness of
special education programs, including transition and work experience
programs, to collect and utilize social security numbers of
individuals with exceptional needs as pupil identification numbers
beginning in the 1993-94 fiscal year and phased in over a 2-year
period. In a situation where a social security number is not
available, existing law requires the superintendent to assign another
student identification number for purposes of evaluating special
education programs and related services. </em> <em>
   This bill would repeal that authorization and would instead
require the superintendent, commencing with the 2017-18 fiscal year
and phased in over a 2-year period, to assign a student
identification number to individuals with exceptional needs for
purposes of evaluating special education programs and related
services. The bill would prohibit school districts from collecting or
soliciting social security numbers or the last 4 digits of social
security numbers from pupils or their parents or guardians unless
otherwise required to do so by state or federal law, and would
authorize the State Department of Education to additionally prohibit
the collection and solicitation of other personally identifiable
information, as recommended by the superintendent and approved by the
State Board of Education. </em> <strike>
   Existing law authorizes, among other things, the governing board
of any high school district to establish and maintain, in connection
with any high school or regional occupational center or program under
its jurisdiction, cooperative career technical education programs or
community classrooms as part of a career technical education course,
as specified. </strike> <strike>
   This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to this provision.
</strike>
   Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: <strike>no
</strike> <em> yes </em> . State-mandated local program: no.

  <em> SECTION 1. </em>  <em> Section 49076.7 is added to the </em>
<em> Education Code </em> <em> , to read: </em> <em>

for identity theft when providing their social security numbers.
   (2) A technical brief titled "Data Stewardship: Managing
Personally Identifiable Information in Electronic Student Education
Records" published by the United States Department of Education
states that social security numbers are the single most misused piece
of information by criminals perpetrating identity thefts.
   (b) A school district shall not collect or solicit social security
numbers or the last four digits of social security numbers from
pupils or their parents or guardians unless otherwise required to do
so by state or federal law.

solicitation of other personally identifiable information, as
recommended by the Superintendent and approved by the state board.

manner prescribed by the superintendent and developed in consultation
with the special education local plan areas, in order for the

to Section 56602. This information shall include other statistical
