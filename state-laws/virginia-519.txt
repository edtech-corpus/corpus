"School service provider" means an entity that operates a school service pursuant to a contract with a local school division in the Commonwealth.

"Student personal information" means information collected through a school service that identifies an a currently or formerly enrolled individual student or is linked to information that identifies an a currently or formerly enrolled individual student.

B. Each school service provider shall:

1. Provide clear and easy-to-understand information about the types of student personal information it collects through any school service and how it maintains, uses, or shares such student personal information;

2. Maintain a policy for the privacy of student personal information for each school service and provide prominent notice before making material changes to its policy for the privacy of student personal information for the relevant school service;

6. When it collects student personal information directly from the student, obtain the consent of the student or, if the student is less than 18 years of age, his parent before using student personal information in a manner that is inconsistent with its policy for the privacy of student personal information for the relevant school service, and when it collects student personal information from an individual or entity other than the student, obtain the consent of the school division before using student personal information in a manner that is inconsistent with its policy for the privacy of student personal information for the relevant school service; and

7. Ensure that any successor entity or third party with whom it contracts abides by its policy for the privacy of student personal information and comprehensive information security program before accessing student personal information.

C. No school service provider shall:

2. Use or share any student personal information to create a personal profile of a student other than for supporting purposes authorized in the contract between the school division and the school service provider, with the consent of the student or, if the student is less than 18 years of age, his parent, or as otherwise authorized in the contract between the school division and the school service provider;

3. Knowingly retain student personal information beyond the time period authorized in the contract between the school division and the school service provider, except with the consent of the student or, if the student is less than 18 years of age, his parent; or
