  	institution described by Subsection (b) or a parent or legal
  	guardian of a minor applicant to an educational institution
  	described by Subsection (b) requests information in the record of
  	the applicant, the educational institution shall disclose any
  	information that:
  	             (1)  is related to the applicant's application for
  	admission; and 
  	             (2)  was provided to the educational institution by the
