Legislative Counsel’s Digest: 
 
In  2015,  Congress  passed  the  Every  Student  Succeeds  Act  of  2015,  which 
replaced  the  No  Child  Left  Behind  Act  of  2001  and  was  a  significant 
reauthorization  of  the  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  Act  of  1965.  (20 
U.S.C.  §§  6301  et  seq.)  Sections  6,  7,  56,  58,  75  and  76  of  this  bill  replace 
references  to  the  No  Child  Left  Behind  Act  of  2001  with  references  to  the  Every 
Student Succeeds Act of 2015. Sections 2, 32, 38, 43, 71 and 72 revise references 
to federal law to conform to changes made in the Every Student Succeeds Act of 
2015. Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 15, 16, 19-21, 23, 24, 26-29, 31, 33, 35, 39, 55, 56, 
71, 73, 74 and 77-82 of this bill revise terminology to conform with the revisions to 
the federal law. 
 
Existing  law  requires  the  principal  of  each  school,  in  consultation  with  the 
employees  of  the  school,  to  prepare  a  plan  to  improve  the  achievement  of  pupils 
enrolled  in  the  school  and  prescribes  the  requirements  for  such  a  plan.  (NRS 
385A.650)  Section  19  of  this  bill  removes  the  statutory  requirements  concerning 
the  contents  of  the  plan  and  instead  requires  the  State  Board  of  Education  to 
prescribe  the  contents  of  the  plan  by  regulation.  Section  83  of  this  bill  repeals  a 
provision requiring certain schools to carry out a process for peer review of a plan 
to  improve  the  achievement  of  pupils  enrolled  in  the  school  in  accordance  with 
federal law. 
Existing  law  requires  the  State  Board  to  adopt  regulations  for  counting 
 
enrollment  of  pupils  for  apportionment  purposes.  (NRS  387.123)  Section  23.5  of 
this bill prohibits such regulations from counting a pupil enrolled in grade 12 who

Section 41.3 of this bill requires the State Board to adopt regulations regarding 

 
 
 
is not prepared for college and career success as a full-time pupil for apportionment 
purposes unless the pupil is enrolled in a certain number of courses or periods per 
day. 
 
end-of-course finals and the courses for which such finals may be administered.  
 
Existing  law  requires  the  State  Board  to  adopt  regulations  that  prescribe  the 
criteria for receipt of a standard high school diploma. (NRS 390.600) Section 52 of 
this bill removes the requirement that the regulations require a pupil to pass certain 
end-of-course  examinations  to  receive  a  standard  high  school  diploma.  Section 
41.5  of  this  bill  requires  the  State  Board  to  adopt  regulations  that  prescribe  the 
criteria for a pupil to receive a college and career ready high school diploma, which 
must  include  requirements  that  the  pupil:  (1)  satisfy  the  criteria  for  receipt  of  a 
standard  high  school  diploma;  and  (2)  obtain  a  college-ready  endorsement  or  a 
career-ready endorsement. Section 41.5 also requires the State Board to: (1) adopt 
regulations  prescribing  the  criteria  for  a  pupil  to  obtain  each  endorsement;  (2) 
annually  review  and,  if  necessary,  revise  the  regulations  adopted  relating  to  the 
college and career ready high school diploma; and (3) provide incentive grants and 
certain  reimbursements  relating  to  the  college  and  career  ready  high  school 
diploma, to the extent that money is available for this purpose. Finally, section 41.5 
provides that a college and career ready high school diploma confers all the same 
rights, privileges and benefits as a standard high school diploma.  
 
Section 41.7 of this bill requires the Department of Education, to the extent that 
money  is  available,  to  conduct  a  public  awareness  campaign  to  inform  certain 
persons  of  the  types  of  diplomas  and  endorsements  on  a  diploma  a  pupil  may 
receive  upon  graduation  from  high  school  and  the  criteria  for  obtaining  such 
diplomas or endorsements.  
 
Existing  law  requires  the  statewide  performance  evaluation  system  used  to 
evaluate  a  public  school  employee’s  overall  performance  to  include  a  process  for 
peer  evaluations  of  teachers  by  qualified  educational  personnel.  (NRS  391.465) 
Section  66  of  this  bill  requires  the  statewide  performance  evaluation  system  to 
include a process for peer observations, instead of peer evaluations. Sections 65.5 
and 66.5 of this bill make conforming changes. 
 
Existing law requires the State Board to designate the assessments that may be 
used  by  a  school  district to  determine  pupil achievement.  (NRS  391.465)  Section 
66 of this bill instead requires: (1) the State Board to establish the criteria for the 
assessments that may be used by a school district; and (2) the board of trustees of a 
school  district  to  select assessments  that  meet the  criteria  established  by the  State 
Board  to  determine  pupil  achievement.  Existing  law  requires  the  State  Board  to 
select  a  college  and  career  readiness  assessment  for  administration  to  pupils 
enrolled  in  grade  11  in  public  schools.  (NRS  390.610)  Section  53  of  this  bill 
provides that the results of a pupil on this assessment may be used in determining 
whether the pupil satisfies the requirements for receipt of a college and career ready 
high school diploma. Section 53 also requires the State Board to adopt regulations 
prescribing  the  manner  in  which  a  school  district  or  charter  school  that  enrolls 
pupils at a high school grade level is required to use the results of this assessment to 
inform the instruction provided to pupils enrolled in grade 12. 
Existing law requires teachers and administrators to receive certain evaluations 
 
that  are  based  in  part  upon  a  certain  number  of  observations  of  the  teacher  or 
administrator. (NRS 391.685, 391.690, 391.705, 391.710) Sections 67-68.5 of this 
bill require such evaluations to be based on a certain number of observation cycles 
of  each  teacher  and  administrator.  Section  69  of  this  bill  makes  a  technical 
correction to provisions relating to the written evaluation of a probationary teacher 
or administrator. Sections 36, 37 and 59-64 of this bill revise additional provisions 

 -

– 3 – 

 
 
 
governing  the  qualifications  of  certain  teachers  and  paraprofessionals  and 
evaluations of the performance of teachers and paraprofessionals. 
 
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to prepare an 
annual report of accountability concerning the educational goals and objectives of 
the school district. (385A.070) Existing law also requires the State Board to prepare 
a  single  annual  report  of  accountability  for  all  public  schools  in  the  State  that 
includes certain information. (NRS 385A.400) Sections 9 and 13 of this bill revise 
the  contents  of  such  annual  reports  of  accountability  and  require  the  reports  to 
include certain information concerning educational personnel.

(a)  The progress of pupils enrolled in a public school for which 
an  alternative  performance  framework  has  been  approved  pursuant 
to NRS 385A.740 will be accounted for within the statewide system 
of accountability; and

  Sec.  23.    NRS 387.121 is hereby amended to read as follows: 
 
387.121    1.    The Legislature declares that the proper objective 
of  state  financial  aid  to  public  education  is  to  ensure  each  Nevada 
child a reasonably equal educational opportunity. Recognizing wide 
local  variations  in  wealth  and  costs  per  pupil,  this  State  should 
supplement  local  financial  ability  to  whatever  extent  necessary  in 
each  school  district  to  provide  programs  of  instruction  in  both 
compulsory  and  elective  subjects  that  offer  full  opportunity  for 
every Nevada child to receive the benefit of the purposes for which 
public  schools  are  maintained.  Therefore,  the  quintessence  of  the 
State’s financial obligation for such programs can be expressed in a 
formula partially on a per pupil basis and partially on a per program 
basis as: State financial aid to school districts equals the difference 
between  school  district  basic  support  guarantee  and  local  available 
funds  produced  by  mandatory  taxes  minus  all  the  local  funds 
attributable  to  pupils  who  reside  in  the  county  but  attend  a  charter 
school  or  a  university  school  for  profoundly  gifted  pupils.  This 
formula is designated the Nevada Plan. 
 
2.    It  is  the  intent  of  the  Legislature,  commencing  with  Fiscal 
Year 2016-2017, to provide additional resources to the Nevada Plan 
expressed as a multiplier of the basic support guarantee to meet the 
unique  needs  of  certain  categories  of  pupils,  including,  without 
limitation, pupils with disabilities, pupils who are [limited] English 
[proficient,] learners, pupils who are at risk and gifted and talented 
pupils.  As  used  in  this  subsection,  “pupils  who  are  at  risk”  means 
pupils  who  are  eligible  for  free  or  reduced-price  lunch  pursuant

consider the factors set forth in subsection 3 and determine whether 
the  pupil  is  eligible  for  a  good-cause  exemption.  In  making  the 
determination,  the  principal  must  consider  documentation  provided 
by the pupil’s teacher indicating whether the promotion of the pupil 
is  appropriate  based  upon

documentation must only consist of the existing plan for monitoring 
the  progress  of  the  pupil,  the  pupil’s  individualized  education 
program,  if  applicable,  and  the  pupil’s  plan  in  accordance  with 
section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  29  U.S.C.  §  794,  if 
applicable. If the principal determines that promotion of the pupil to 
grade  4  is  appropriate,  the  principal  must  submit  a  written 
recommendation  to  the  superintendent  of  schools  of  the  school 
district or to the governing body of the charter school, as applicable.

or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, approves 
the good-cause exemption. 
 
6.    The principal of a school in which a pupil for whom a good-
cause exemption is approved and who is promoted to grade 4 must 
ensure that the pupil continues to receive intensive instruction in the 
subject  area  of  reading.  Such  instruction  must  include,  without 
limitation,  strategies  based  upon  [scientifically  based]  evidence-
based  research  that  will  improve  proficiency  in  the  subject  area  of 
reading.
