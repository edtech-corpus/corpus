516     district is within the boundaries of a school district other than the school district that includes
517     the other interlocal agreement participants.
518          (iii) (A) Notwithstanding Subsection (2)(b)(i)(C)(II), a proposal to create a new school
519     district may be submitted for voter approval pursuant to an interlocal agreement under
520     Subsection (2)(a), even though the new school district boundaries would create an isolated
521     area, if:
522          (I) the potential isolated area is contiguous to one or more of the interlocal agreement
523     participants;
524          (II) the interlocal participants submit a written request to the municipality in which the
525     potential isolated area is located, requesting the municipality to enter into an interlocal
526     agreement under Subsection (2)(a) that proposes to submit for voter approval a measure to
527     create a new school district that includes the potential isolated area; and
528          (III) 90 days after a request under Subsection (2)(d)(iii)(A)(II) is submitted, the
529     municipality has not entered into an interlocal agreement as requested in the request.

540     municipality's school district.
541          (III) Unless the isolated area is the only remaining part of the existing district, the
542     process described in Subsection (4) shall be modified to:
543          (Aa) include a third transition team, appointed by the local school board of the
544     municipality's school district, to represent that school district; and

753     53G-3-302 in accordance with Section 53G-3-302.
754          (2) Title vests in the new local school board, including all rights, claims, and causes of
755     action to or for the property, for the use or the income from the property, for conversion,

766          (b) The proportionate share of the divided school district's outstanding indebtedness for
767     which property within the new district remains subject to the levy of taxes shall be calculated

798     from the tax rate specified in Subsection (5)(a).
799          (6) (a) The local school boards of the remaining and new districts shall determine by

869          (6) State funds received by the new district under Section 53F-3-202 may be applied
870     toward the payment of outstanding bonded indebtedness of a former district in the same

933          (viii) The decision of the state board is final.
934          (3) (a) The electors of each affected district shall vote on the transfer requested under

978     pay the assumed indebtedness, and shall turn over the proceeds of the tax to the business
979     administrator of the transferor local school board.

1689     may not replace operating funds intercepted by the state with money collected and held to make
1690     payments on bonds if that replacement would divert money from the payment of future debt
1691     service on the bonds and increase the risk that the state's guaranty would be called upon a
1692     second time.

3154     to a court-ordered guardianship under Section 75-5-206 and will suspend or terminate any
3155     existing parental or guardianship rights in the same manner as would occur under a
3156     court-ordered guardianship;
3157          (iv) the affiant consents and submits to any such suspension or termination of parental

3186     the statement required under Subsection (2)(a), the responsible adult must submit an affidavit

3194     application for guardianship.
3195          (4) Upon receipt of the information and documentation required under Subsections (2)
3196     and (3), and a determination by the local school board that the information is accurate, that the
3197     requirements of this section have been met, and that the interests of the child would best be
3198     served by granting the requested guardianship, the local school board or its authorized

3200     guardianship letter to the applicant.
3201          (5) (a) If a local school board has adopted a policy permitting the local school board to
3202     designate a guardian under this section, a denial of an application for appointment of a
3203     guardian may be appealed to the district court in which the school district is located.
3204          (b) The court shall uphold the decision of the local school board unless it finds, by
3205     clear and convincing evidence, that the local school board's decision was arbitrary and
3206     capricious.
3207          (c) An applicant may, rather than appealing the local school board's decision under
3208     Subsection (5)(b), file an original Petition for Appointment of Guardian with the district court,
3209     which action shall proceed as if no decision had been made by the local school board.

3213     district, together with a copy of the designation of guardianship issued by the district, in person

3219     submitting an affidavit under this section may be restored by the district, and the guardianship
3220     obtained under this section terminated by the district:

3222     signed and notarized statement by the person who consented to guardianship under Subsection
3223     (2)(a) requesting termination of the guardianship; or
3224          (ii) by the person accepting guardianship under Subsection (2)(b) requesting the
3225     termination of the guardianship.
3226          (b) If the school district determines that it would not be in the best interests of the child
3227     to terminate the guardianship, the district may refer the request for termination to the state
3228     district court in which the documents were filed under Subsection (5) for further action
3229     consistent with the interests of the child.
3230          (9) The school district shall retain copies of all documents required by this section

3236     submitted false or misleading information under this part may, after notice and opportunity for
3237     the party to respond to the allegation:
3238          (i) void any guardianship, authorization, or action which was based upon the false or
3239     misleading information; and
3240          (ii) recover, from the party submitting the information, the full cost of any benefits
3241     received by the child on the basis of the false or misleading information, including tuition, fees,
3242     and other unpaid school charges, together with any related costs of recovery.
3243          (c) A student whose guardianship or enrollment has been terminated under this section
3244     may, upon payment of all applicable tuition and fees, continue in enrollment until the end of

3550          (b) The parent [or guardian] of the student shall arrange for the student's transportation
3551     to and from school, except that the district shall provide transportation on the basis of available
