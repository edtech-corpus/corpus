Except as provided in this section and K.S.A. 74-4925, 74-4927, 75-6501 
through 75-6511 and 76-749, and amendments  thereto, no state agency

and insurance and such insurance may be purchased without complying 
with   K.S.A.   75-3738   through   75-3744,   and   amendments   thereto.  Any 
board of county commissioners  may purchase such insurance  or health 
care services, independent of such committee, for district court officers 
and employees any part of whose total salary is payable by the county. 
Nothing in any other provision of the laws of this state shall be construed 
as prohibiting members of the highway patrol so assigned to police toll or 
turnpike facilities from receiving compensation in the form of insurance or 
health maintenance organization coverage as herein authorized.

(c) The agencies of the state sponsoring a foster grandparent or senior 
companion program, or both, shall procure a policy of accident, personal 
liability   and   excess   automobile   liability   insurance   insuring   volunteers 
participating   in   such   programs   against   loss   in   accordance   with 
specifications   of   federal   grant   guidelines.   Such   agencies   may   purchase 
such policy of insurance independent of the committee on surety bonds 
and insurance and without complying with K.S.A. 75-3738 through 75-
3744, and amendments thereto.

(d) Any state educational institution as defined by K.S.A. 76-711, and 
amendments thereto, may purchase insurance of any kind or nature except 
employee   health   insurance.   Such   insurance   shall   be   purchased   on   a 
competitively  bid   or   competitively  negotiated   basis   in   accordance   with 
procedures prescribed by the state board of regents. Such insurance may 
be purchased independent of the committee on surety bonds and insurance 
and   without   complying   with   K.S.A.   75-3738   through   75-3744,   and 
amendments thereto.

(e) (1) The state board of regents may enter into one or more group 
insurance contracts to provide health and accident insurance coverage or 
health care services of a health maintenance organization for all students 
attending a state educational institution as defined in K.S.A. 76-711, and 
amendments   thereto,   and   such   students'   dependents,   except   that   such 
insurance shall not provide coverage for elective procedures that are not 
medically   necessary   as   determined   by   a   treating   physician.   The 
participation by a student in such coverage shall be voluntary. In the case 
of students who are employed by a state educational institution in a student 
position, the level of employer contributions toward such coverage shall be 
determined by the board of regents.

(2) The state board of regents is hereby authorized to independently 
provide,   through   self-insurance   or   the   purchase   of   insurance   contracts, 
health care benefits  for employees  of a  state educational  institution, as 
such term is defined in K.S.A. 76-711, and amendments thereto, when the 
state health care benefits program is insufficient to satisfy the requirements 
of 22 C.F.R. § 62.14, as in effect upon the effective date of this section. 
Such healthcare benefits shall be limited to only those for whom the state

health care benefits program does not meet federal requirements.

(3) The state board of regents may purchase cybersecurity insurance  
as it deems necessary to protect student records, labor information and  
other statutorily protected data that the board maintains, independent of  
the committee on surety bonds and insurance and without complying with  
the   provisions   of   K.S.A.75-3738   through   75-3744,   and   amendments 
thereto. As used in this paragraph, "cybersecurity insurance" includes, but  
is   not   limited   to,   first-party   coverage   against   losses   such   as   data 
destruction, denial of service attacks, theft, hacking and liability coverage  
guaranteeing compensation for damages from errors such as the failure to  
safeguard data. 

(3)  (4) The state board of regents may adopt rules and regulations 

necessary to administer and implement the provisions of this section.

Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 75-4101 is hereby repealed.
