AN ACT

To  enact  R.S.  17:3913,  relative  to  the  transfer  of  personal  student  information  by  local

education  agencies  and  the  state  Department  of  Education;  to  require  that

information regarding such transfers be made available on the Internet; to provide

for deadlines; and to provide for related matters.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of Louisiana:

Section 1.  R.S. 17:3913 is hereby enacted to read as follows:

ยง3913.  Transfer of personally identifiable student information

A.(1)  Parents and citizens are increasingly concerned about the commercial

and criminal uses of student information.  It is therefore the intent of this Section to

ensure that parents and citizens have an accurate picture of those transfers.  The

legislature finds that, if they are provided accurate information, parents and citizens

will be in a better position to judge the validity and safety of various transfers and

to bring focused pressure to bear on policy makers when they have concerns.

(2)  The purpose of this Section is to increase awareness of the transfer of

student  information  by  requiring  the  state  Department  of  Education  and  local

education agencies to publicize such information on their Internet websites.

B.    By  January  1,  2015,  the  state  Department  of  Education  shall  make

available  on  its  website  information  about  the  transfer  of  personally  identifiable

student information.  Such information shall include but need not be limited to all of

the following:

(1)  A profile of each authorized recipient of such information.

(3)  A complete listing of all of the data elements authorized to be transferred.

to  legal  authority  or  legal  requirements  associated  with  the  transfer  of  such

information.

(5)    The  name  and  contact  information  of  the  individual  serving  as  the

primary point of contact for inquiries about the agreement.

(6)  A process by which parents of students attending public schools may

register a complaint related to the unauthorized transfer of personally identifiable

student information.

C.  By January 1, 2015, each local education agency that has a website shall

make  available  on  its  website  information  about  the  transfer  of  personally

identifiable  student  information.  Such  information  shall  include  but  need  not  be

limited to all of the following:

(1)  A profile of each authorized recipient of such information.

(2)  A copy of the signed agreement between the local education agency and

the authorized recipient.

(3)  A complete listing of all of the data elements authorized to be transferred.

(4)  A statement of the intended use of the information, including references

to  legal  authority  or  legal  requirements  associated  with  the  transfer  of  such

information.

(5)    The  name  and  contact  information  of  the  individual  serving  as  the

primary point of contact for inquiries about the agreement.

(6)  A process by which parents of students attending public schools may

register a complaint related to the unauthorized transfer of personally identifiable

student information.
