c.

Reduced by an amount equal to the sum determined by 
application of the base year's calculated mill rate for that taxing 
district to the final base year taxable valuation of any taxable 
property and property exempt by local discretion or charitable 
status which is not included in the taxing district for the budget 
year but was included in the taxing district for the base year.
