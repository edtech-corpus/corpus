A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND AUTHORIZING THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
TO APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO UNDERTAKE AND COMPLETE A STUDY OF THE STATE'S
ELEMENTARY, SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEMS.

Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:

WHEREAS, the members of the Second Regular Session of the Sixty-second
Idaho Legislature passed the Student Data Accessibility, Transparency and
Accountability Act of 2014 to ensure that student information is protected
and expectations of privacy are honored; and

WHEREAS, in passing the Act, the Legislature acknowledged that student
information is a vital resource for teachers and school staff in planning re-
sponsive education programs and services, scheduling students into appro-
priate classes and completing reports for educational agencies; and

WHEREAS, the Legislature also affirmed that while student information
is important for educational purposes, it is also critically important to
ensure that student information is protected, safeguarded and kept private
and used only by appropriate educational authorities and then, only to serve
the best interests of the student; and

WHEREAS, Idaho citizens have expressed concerns about the Act and
whether implementation of its provisions do serve the best interests of the
students; and

WHEREAS, the concerns expressed include the privacy and security poli-
cies and procedures required to be developed under the Act; the efficacy of
the technology used to collect and report student data, and to interface with
private and public entities; the costs associated with the data system; and
the federal government's mandated student data collection and reporting re-
quirements, which intrude upon Idaho's state sovereignty and student pri-
vacy.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
sion of the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and
the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislative Council is authorized to
appoint a committee to undertake and complete a study of the state's elemen-
tary, secondary and postsecondary longitudinal data systems including, but
not necessarily limited to, determining: (1) which data points are neces-
sary for tracking student academic progress; (2) which data points must be
collected and reported at the aggregate level; (3) which data points should
be personally identifiable and why; (4) the extent to which federal fund-
ing is contingent upon the collection and reporting of student data to the
federal government and the cost to the state of declining such funding; and
(5) recommendations on: (a) simplifying and minimizing the collection of
student data without compromising essential evaluation of educational effi-
cacy; (b) protecting student privacy by limiting the collection of person-
ally identifiable data; and (c) the cost/benefit of declining federal funds

to save local funds, protect privacy and maintain local control of educa-
tion as they relate to data collection. The Legislative Council shall deter-
mine the number of legislators and membership from each house appointed to
the committee and shall authorize the committee to receive input, advice and
assistance from interested and affected parties who are not members of the
Legislature.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that nonlegislative members of the committee may
be appointed by the cochairs of the committee who are appointed by the Leg-
islative Council. Nonlegislative members of the advisory committee shall
not be reimbursed from legislative funds for per diem, mileage or other ex-
penses and shall not have voting privileges regarding the committee's recom-
mendations or proposed legislation.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the committee shall report its findings,
recommendations and proposed legislation, if any, to the Second Regular
Session of the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature.
