Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This act shall be known as the "Student Data Ac-

cessibility, Transparency and Accountability Act of 2014."

SECTION 2. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the Legislature to
help ensure that student information is safeguarded and that privacy is hon-
ored, respected and protected. The Legislature also acknowledges that stu-
dent information is a vital resource for teachers and school staff in plan-
ning responsive education programs and services, scheduling students into
appropriate classes and completing reports for educational agencies. Stu-
dent information is critical in helping educators assist students in suc-
cessfully graduating from high school and being ready to enter the workforce
or postsecondary education. In emergencies, certain information should be
readily available to school officials to assist students and their families.
A limited amount of this information makes up a student's permanent record
or transcript. The Legislature firmly believes that while student informa-
tion is important for educational purposes, it is also critically important
to ensure that student information is protected, safeguarded and kept pri-
vate and used only by appropriate educational authorities and then, only to
serve the best interests of the student. To that end, this act will help en-
sure that student information is protected and expectations of privacy are
honored.
