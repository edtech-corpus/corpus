Public Act 100-0315 SB1796 Enrolled LRB100 08966 MLM 19112 b AN ACT concerning education. Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly: Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Student Online Personal
Protection Act. Section 3. Legislative intent. Schools today are increasingly using a wide range of beneficial online services and other technologies to help students learn, but concerns have been raised about whether sufficient safeguards exist to protect
the privacy and security of data about students when it is collected by educational technology companies. This Act is intended to ensure that student data will be protected when it is collected by educational technology companies and that the data may
be used for beneficial purposes such as providing personalized learning and innovative educational technologies. Section 5. Definitions. In this Act: "Covered information" means personally identifiable information or material or information that is linked
to personally identifiable information or material in any media or format that is not publicly available and is any of the following: (1) Created by or provided to an operator by a student or the student's parent or legal guardian in the course of the
student's, parent's, or legal guardian's use of the operator's site, service, or application for K through 12 school purposes. (2) Created by or provided to an operator by an employee or agent of a school or school district for K through 12 school purposes.
(3) Gathered by an operator through the operation of its site, service, or application for K through 12 school purposes and personally identifies a student, including, but not limited to, information in the student's educational record or electronic mail,
first and last name, home address, telephone number, electronic mail address, or other information that allows physical or online contact, discipline records, test results, special education data, juvenile dependency records, grades, evaluations, criminal
records, medical records, health records, a social security number, biometric information, disabilities, socioeconomic information, food purchases, political affiliations, religious information, text messages, documents, student identifiers, search activity,
photos, voice recordings, or geolocation information. "Interactive computer service" has the meaning ascribed to that term in Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. 230). "K through 12 school purposes" means purposes
that are directed by or that customarily take place at the direction of a school, teacher, or school district; aid in the administration of school activities, including, but not limited to, instruction in the classroom or at home, administrative activities,
and collaboration between students, school personnel, or parents; or are otherwise for the use and benefit of the school. "Operator" means, to the extent that an entity is operating in this capacity, the operator of an Internet website, online service,
online application, or mobile application with actual knowledge that the site, service, or application is used primarily for K through 12 school purposes and was designed and marketed for K through 12 school purposes. "School" means (1) any preschool,
public kindergarten, elementary or secondary educational institution, vocational school, special educational facility, or any other elementary or secondary educational agency or institution or (2) any person, agency, or institution that maintains school
student records from more than one school. "School" includes a private or nonpublic school. "Targeted advertising" means presenting advertisements to a student where the advertisement is selected based on information obtained or inferred over time from
that student's online behavior, usage of applications, or covered information. The term does not include advertising to a student at an online location based upon that student's current visit to that location or in response to that student's request for
information or feedback, without the retention of that student's online activities or requests over time for the purpose of targeting subsequent ads. Section 10. Operator prohibitions. An operator shall not knowingly do any of the following: (1) Engage
in targeted advertising on the operator's site, service, or application or target advertising on any other site, service, or application if the targeting of the advertising is based on any information, including covered information and persistent unique
identifiers, that the operator has acquired because of the use of that operator's site, service, or application for K through 12 school purposes. (2) Use information, including persistent unique identifiers, created or gathered by the operator's site,
service, or application to amass a profile about a student, except in furtherance of K through 12 school purposes. "Amass a profile" does not include the collection and retention of account information that remains under the control of the student, the
student's parent or legal guardian, or the school. (3) Sell or rent a student's information, including covered information. This subdivision (3) does not apply to the purchase, merger, or other type of acquisition of an operator by another entity if the
operator or successor entity complies with this Act regarding previously acquired student information. (4) Except as otherwise provided in Section 20 of this Act, disclose covered information, unless the disclosure is made for the following purposes:
(A) In furtherance of the K through 12 school purposes of the site, service, or application if the recipient of the covered information disclosed under this clause (A) does not further disclose the information, unless done to allow or improve operability
and functionality of the operator's site, service, or application. (B) To ensure legal and regulatory compliance or take precautions against liability. (C) To respond to the judicial process. (D) To protect the safety or integrity of users of the site
or others or the security of the site, service, or application. (E) For a school, educational, or employment purpose requested by the student or the student's parent or legal guardian, provided that the information is not used or further disclosed for
any other purpose. (F) To a third party if the operator contractually prohibits the third party from using any covered information for any purpose other than providing the contracted service to or on behalf of the operator, prohibits the third party from
disclosing any covered information provided by the operator with subsequent third parties, and requires the third party to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices. Nothing in this Section prohibits the operator's use of information
for maintaining, developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's site, service, or application. Section 15. Operator duties. An operator shall do the following: (1) Implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate
to the nature of the covered information and designed to protect that covered information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. (2) Delete, within a reasonable time period, a student's covered information if the school

information about its collection, use, and disclosure of covered information, including, but not limited to, publishing a terms of service agreement, privacy policy, or similar document. Section 20. Permissive use or disclosure. An operator may use or

protecting and disclosing that information. (2) For legitimate research purposes as required by State or federal law and subject to the restrictions under applicable State and federal law or as allowed by State or federal law and under the direction of
a school, school district, or the State Board of Education if the covered information is not used for advertising or to amass a profile on the student for purposes other than for K through 12 school purposes. (3) To a State or local educational agency,
including schools and school districts, for K through 12 school purposes, as permitted by State or federal law. Section 25. Operator actions that are not prohibited. This Act does not prohibit an operator from doing any of the following: (1) Using covered

an online site, service, or application if the recommendation is not determined in whole or in part by payment or other consideration from a third party. (B) Additional services relating to an educational, other learning, or employment opportunity purpose
within an online site, service, or application if the recommendation is not determined in whole or in part by payment or other consideration from a third party. (5) Responding to a student's request for information or for feedback without the information
or response being determined in whole or in part by payment or other consideration from a third party. Section 30. Applicability. This Act does not do any of the following: (1) Limit the authority of a law enforcement agency to obtain any content or information
from an operator as authorized by law or under a court order. (2) Limit the ability of an operator to use student data, including covered information, for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes. (3) Apply to general audience Internet
