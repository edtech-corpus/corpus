per cent of its tax valuation, except as provided in divisions (G) and (H) of
this section and in division (C) of section 3313.372 of the Revised Code, or
as prescribed in section 3318.052 or 3318.44 of the Revised Code, or as

district's net indebtedness after the issuance of the securities exceed an

Am. Sub. H. B. No. 487

130th G.A.

3

amount equal to four per cent of its tax valuation, unless the superintendent
of public instruction, acting under policies adopted by the state board of
education, and the tax commissioner, acting under written policies of the
commissioner, consent to the submission. A request for the consents shall be
made at least one hundred twenty days prior to the election at which the
question is to be submitted.

The superintendent of public instruction shall certify to the district the
superintendent's and the tax commissioner's decisions within thirty days
after receipt of the request for consents.

If the electors do not approve the issuance of securities at the election
for which the superintendent of public instruction and tax commissioner
consented to the submission of the question, the school district may submit
the same question to the electors on the date that the next special election
may be held under section 3501.01 of the Revised Code without submitting
a new request for consent. If the school district seeks to submit the same
question at any other subsequent election, the district shall first submit a
new request for consent in accordance with this division.

(D) In calculating the net indebtedness of a school district, none of the

following shall be considered:

(1) Securities issued to acquire school buses and other equipment used
in transporting pupils or issued pursuant to division (D) of section 133.10 of
the Revised Code;

stated in division (B) of this section, under division (E) of this section;

(3) Indebtedness resulting from the dissolution of a joint vocational
school district under section 3311.217 of the Revised Code, evidenced by
outstanding securities of that joint vocational school district;

(4) Loans, evidenced by any securities,

received under sections

3313.483, 3317.0210, and 3317.0211 of the Revised Code;

(5) Debt incurred under section 3313.374 of the Revised Code;
(6) Debt incurred pursuant to division (B)(5) of section 3313.37 of the

Revised Code to acquire computers and related hardware;

(7) Debt incurred under section 3318.042 of the Revised Code.
(E) A school district may become a special needs district as to certain

securities as provided in division (E) of this section.

(1) A board of education, by resolution, may declare its school district

to be a special needs district by determining both of the following:

(a) The student population is not being adequately serviced by the

existing permanent improvements of the district.

Am. Sub. H. B. No. 487

130th G.A.

(b) The district cannot obtain sufficient funds by the issuance of
securities within the limitation of division (B) of this section to provide
additional or improved needed permanent improvements in time to meet the
needs.

superintendent of public instruction with a statistical report showing all of
the following:

(a) The history of and a projection of the growth of the tax valuation;
(b) The projected needs;

such projected needs.

(3) The superintendent of public instruction shall certify the district as
an approved special needs district if the superintendent finds both of the
following:

(a) The district does not have available sufficient additional funds from

state or federal sources to meet the projected needs.

(b) The projection of the potential average growth of tax valuation
during the next five years, according to the information certified to the
superintendent and any other
information the superintendent obtains,
indicates a likelihood of potential average growth of tax valuation of the
district during the next five years of an average of not less than one and
the
one-half per cent per year. The findings and certification of
superintendent shall be conclusive.

(4) An approved special needs district may incur net indebtedness by the
issuance of securities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter in an
amount that does not exceed an amount equal to the greater of the following:
(a) Twelve per cent of the sum of its tax valuation plus an amount that is
the product of multiplying that tax valuation by the percentage by which the
tax valuation has increased over the tax valuation on the first day of the
sixtieth month preceding the month in which its board determines to submit
to the electors the question of issuing the proposed securities;

(b) Twelve per cent of the sum of its tax valuation plus an amount that is
the product of multiplying that tax valuation by the percentage, determined
by the superintendent of public instruction, by which that tax valuation is
projected to increase during the next ten years.

(F) A school district may issue securities for emergency purposes, in a
principal amount that does not exceed an amount equal to three per cent of
its tax valuation, as provided in this division.

or that corrections to permanent improvements are necessary to remove or
prevent health or safety hazards.
(b) Existing fiscal and net

indebtedness limitations make adequate

replacement, additions, or improvements impossible.

(2) Upon the declaration of an emergency, the board of education may,
by resolution, submit to the electors of the district pursuant to section 133.18
of the Revised Code the question of issuing securities for the purpose of
paying the cost, in excess of any insurance or condemnation proceeds
received by the district, of permanent improvements to respond to the
emergency need.

(3) The procedures for the election shall be as provided in section

133.18 of the Revised Code, except that:

(a) The form of the ballot shall describe the emergency existing, refer to
this division as the authority under which the emergency is declared, and
state that the amount of the proposed securities exceeds the limitations
prescribed by division (B) of this section;

(b) The resolution required by division (B) of section 133.18 of the
Revised Code shall be certified to the county auditor and the board of
elections at least one hundred days prior to the election;

before the election, confirm that advice by certification to, the board of
education of the information required by division (C) of section 133.18 of
the Revised Code;

information required by division (D) of section 133.18 of the Revised Code
to the board of elections not less than ninety days prior to the election.

(4) Notwithstanding division (B) of section 133.21 of the Revised Code,
the first principal payment of securities issued under this division may be set

payment otherwise provided for in that division.

(G)(1) The board of education may contract with an architect,
professional engineer, or other person experienced in the design and
implementation of energy conservation measures for an analysis and
recommendations pertaining to installations, modifications of installations,
or remodeling that would significantly reduce energy consumption in

Am. Sub. H. B. No. 487

130th G.A.

buildings owned by the district. The report shall include estimates of all
costs of such installations, modifications, or remodeling, including costs of
design, engineering, installation, maintenance, repairs, measurement and
verification of energy savings, and debt service, forgone residual value of
materials or equipment replaced by the energy conservation measure, as
defined by the Ohio school facilities commission, a baseline analysis of
actual energy consumption data for the preceding three years with the utility
baseline based on only the actual energy consumption data for the preceding
twelve months, and estimates of the amounts by which energy consumption
and resultant operational and maintenance costs, as defined by the
commission, would be reduced.

If the board finds after receiving the report that the amount of money the
district would spend on such installations, modifications, or remodeling is
not likely to exceed the amount of money it would save in energy and
resultant operational and maintenance costs over the ensuing fifteen years,
the board may submit to the commission a copy of its findings and a request
for approval to incur indebtedness to finance the making or modification of
installations or the remodeling of buildings for the purpose of significantly
reducing energy consumption.

The school facilities commission, in consultation with the auditor of
state, may deny a request under this division by the board of education any
school district is in a state of fiscal watch pursuant to division (A) of section
3316.03 of the Revised Code, if it determines that the expenditure of funds
is not in the best interest of the school district.

No district board of education of a school district that is in a state of
fiscal emergency pursuant to division (B) of section 3316.03 of the Revised
Code shall

provided that the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) The commission determines that the board's findings are reasonable.
(b) The request for approval is complete.
(c) The installations, modifications, or remodeling are consistent with
any project to construct or acquire classroom facilities, or to reconstruct or
make additions to existing classroom facilities under sections 3318.01 to
3318.20 or sections 3318.40 to 3318.45 of the Revised Code.

Upon receipt of the commission's approval,

the district may issue
securities without a vote of the electors in a principal amount not to exceed
nine-tenths of one per cent of its tax valuation for the purpose of making
the total net

and all other sections of the Revised Code, except section 3318.052 of the
Revised Code, shall not exceed one per cent of the district's tax valuation.

(3) So long as any securities issued under

this division remain
outstanding, the board of education shall monitor the energy consumption
and resultant operational and maintenance costs of buildings in which
installations or modifications have been made or remodeling has been done
pursuant to this division and. Except as provided in division (G)(4) of this
section, the board shall maintain and annually update a report in a form and
manner prescribed by the school facilities commission documenting the
reductions in energy consumption and resultant operational and maintenance
cost savings attributable to such installations, modifications, or remodeling.
The report shall be certified by an architect or engineer independent of any
person that provided goods or services to the board in connection with the
energy conservation measures that are the subject of the report. The
resultant operational and maintenance cost savings shall be certified by the
school district treasurer. The report shall be submitted annually to the
commission.

(4) If the school facilities commission verifies that the certified annual
reports submitted to the commission by a board of education under division
(G)(3) of this section fulfill the guarantee required under division (B) of
section 3313.372 of the Revised Code for three consecutive years, the board
of education shall no longer be subject to the annual reporting requirements
of division (G)(3) of this section.

(H) With the consent of the superintendent of public instruction, a
school district may incur without a vote of the electors net indebtedness that
exceeds the amounts stated in divisions (A) and (G) of this section for the
purpose of paying costs of permanent improvements, if and to the extent that

the securities issued to evidence that indebtedness and payable from those
receipts, and the taxing authority of the district confirms the fiscal officer's
estimate, which confirmation is approved by the superintendent of public
instruction;

approved by the department of education as conforming to requirements of
federal law for receipt of federal funds for disadvantaged pupils. To the
extent possible, the individualized education program shall not excuse the
student from taking an assessment unless no reasonable accommodation can
be made to enable the student to take the assessment.

(b) Any alternate assessment approved by the department for a student
under this division shall produce measurable results comparable to those
produced by the assessment it replaces in order to allow for the student's
results to be included in the data compiled for a school district or building
under section 3302.03 of the Revised Code.

(c) Any student enrolled in a chartered nonpublic school who has been
identified, based on an evaluation conducted in accordance with section
3323.03 of the Revised Code or section 504 of the "Rehabilitation Act of

1973," 87 Stat. 355, 29 U.S.C.A. 794, as amended, as a child with a
disability shall be excused from taking any particular assessment required to
be administered under this section if a plan developed for the student
pursuant to rules adopted by the state board excuses the student from taking
that assessment. In the case of any student so excused from taking an
assessment, the chartered nonpublic school shall not prohibit the student
from taking the assessment.

(2) A district board may, for medical reasons or other good cause,
excuse a student from taking an assessment administered under this section
on the date scheduled, but that assessment shall be administered to the
excused student not later than nine days following the scheduled date. The
district board shall annually report the number of students who have not
taken one or more of the assessments required by this section to the state
board of education not later than the thirtieth day of June.

(3) As used in this division, "limited English proficient student" has the

same meaning as in 20 U.S.C. 7801.

No school district board shall excuse any limited English proficient
student from taking any particular assessment required to be administered
under this section, except that any limited English proficient student who
has been enrolled in United States schools for less than one full school year
shall not be required to take any reading, writing, or English language arts
assessment. However, no board shall prohibit a limited English proficient
student who is not required to take an assessment under this division from
taking the assessment. A board may permit any limited English proficient
student to take an assessment required to be administered under this section
with appropriate accommodations, as determined by the department. For
each limited English proficient student, each school district shall annually
assess that student's progress in learning English,
in accordance with
procedures approved by the department.

The governing authority of a chartered nonpublic school may excuse a
limited English proficient student from taking any assessment administered
under this section. However, no governing authority shall prohibit a limited
English proficient student from taking the assessment.

(D)(1) In the school year next succeeding the school year in which the
assessments prescribed by division (A)(1) or (B)(1) of section 3301.0710 of
the Revised Code or former division (A)(1), (A)(2), or (B) of section
3301.0710 of the Revised Code as it existed prior to September 11, 2001,
are administered to any student, the board of education of any school district
in which the student is enrolled in that year shall provide to the student
intervention services commensurate with the student's performance,

Am. Sub. H. B. No. 487

130th G.A.

25

including any intensive intervention required under section 3313.608 of the
Revised Code, in any skill in which the student failed to demonstrate at least
a score at the proficient level on the assessment.

(2) Following any administration of the assessments prescribed by
division (D) of section 3301.0710 of the Revised Code to ninth grade
students, each school district that has a three-year average graduation rate of
not more than seventy-five per cent shall determine for each high school in
the district whether the school shall be required to provide intervention
services to any students who took the assessments. In determining which
high schools shall provide intervention services based on the resources
available, the district shall consider each school's graduation rate and scores
on the practice assessments. The district also shall consider the scores
received by ninth grade students on the English language arts and
mathematics assessments prescribed under division (A)(1)(f) of section
3301.0710 of the Revised Code in the eighth grade in determining which
high schools shall provide intervention services.

Each high school selected to provide intervention services under this
division shall provide intervention services to any student whose results
indicate that the student is failing to make satisfactory progress toward being
able to attain scores at the proficient level on the Ohio graduation tests.
Intervention services shall be provided in any skill in which a student
demonstrates unsatisfactory progress and shall be commensurate with the
student's performance. Schools shall provide the intervention services prior
to the end of the school year, during the summer following the ninth grade,
in the next succeeding school year, or at any combination of those times.

(E) Except as provided in section 3313.608 of the Revised Code and
division (M) of this section, no school district board of education shall
utilize any student's failure to attain a specified score on an assessment
administered under this section as a factor in any decision to deny the
student promotion to a higher grade level. However, a district board may
choose not to promote to the next grade level any student who does not take
an assessment administered under this section or make up an assessment as
provided by division (C)(2) of this section and who is not exempt from the
requirement to take the assessment under division (C)(3) of this section.

(F) No person shall be charged a fee for taking any assessment

administered under this section.

(G)(1) Each school district board shall designate one location for the
collection of assessments administered in the spring under division (B)(1) of
this section and those administered under divisions (B)(2) to (7) of this
section. Each district board shall submit the assessments to the entity with

Am. Sub. H. B. No. 487

130th G.A.

26

which the department contracts for the scoring of the assessments as
follows:

(a) If the district's total enrollment

in grades kindergarten through
twelve during the first full school week of October was less than two
thousand five hundred, not later than the Friday after all of the assessments
have been administered;

(b) If the district's total enrollment

in grades kindergarten through
twelve during the first full school week of October was two thousand five
hundred or more, but less than seven thousand, not later than the Monday
after all of the assessments have been administered;

(c) If the district's total enrollment

in grades kindergarten through
twelve during the first full school week of October was seven thousand or
more, not later than the Tuesday after all of the assessments have been
administered.

However, any assessment that a student takes during the make-up period
described in division (C)(2) of this section shall be submitted not later than
the Friday following the day the student takes the assessment.

(2) The department or an entity with which the department contracts for
the scoring of the assessment shall send to each school district board a list of
the individual scores of all persons taking an assessment prescribed by
division (A)(1) or (B)(1) of section 3301.0710 of the Revised Code within
sixty days after its administration, but in no case shall the scores be returned
later than the fifteenth day of June following the administration. For
assessments administered under this section by a joint vocational school
district, the department or entity shall also send to each city, local, or
exempted village school district a list of the individual scores of any
students of such city, local, or exempted village school district who are
attending school in the joint vocational school district.

(H) Individual scores on any assessments administered under this
section shall be released by a district board only in accordance with section
3319.321 of the Revised Code and the rules adopted under division (A) of
this section. No district board or its employees shall utilize individual or
aggregate results in any manner that conflicts with rules for the ethical use
of assessments adopted pursuant to division (A) of this section.

(I) Except as provided in division (G) of this section, the department or
an entity with which the department contracts for the scoring of the
assessment shall not release any individual scores on any assessment
administered under this section. The state board of education shall adopt
rules to ensure the protection of student confidentiality at all times. The
rules may require the use of the data verification codes assigned to students

Am. Sub. H. B. No. 487

pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 3301.0714 of the Revised Code to
protect the confidentiality of student scores.

(J) Notwithstanding division (D) of section 3311.52 of the Revised
Code,
this section does not apply to the board of education of any
cooperative education school district except as provided under rules adopted
pursuant to this division.

(1) In accordance with rules that the state board of education shall
adopt, the board of education of any city, exempted village, or local school
district with territory in a cooperative education school district established
pursuant to divisions (A) to (C) of section 3311.52 of the Revised Code may
enter into an agreement with the board of education of the cooperative
education school district for administering any assessment prescribed under
this section to students of the city, exempted village, or local school district
who are attending school in the cooperative education school district.

(2) In accordance with rules that the state board of education shall
adopt, the board of education of any city, exempted village, or local school

pursuant
agreement with the cooperative district that provides for the administration
of any assessment prescribed under this section to both of the following:

(a) Students who are attending school in the cooperative district and
who, if the cooperative district were not established, would be entitled to
attend school in the city, local, or exempted village school district pursuant
to section 3313.64 or 3313.65 of the Revised Code;

(b) Persons described in division (B)(8)(b) of this section.
Any assessment of students pursuant to such an agreement shall be in

lieu of any assessment of such students or persons pursuant to this section.

(K)(1)(a) Except as otherwise provided in division (K)(1)(a) or
(K)(1)(c) of this section, each chartered nonpublic school for which at least
sixty-five per cent of its total enrollment is made up of students who are
participating in state scholarship programs shall administer the elementary
assessments prescribed by section 3301.0710 of the Revised Code. In
accordance with procedures and deadlines prescribed by the department, the
parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the school who is not
participating in a state scholarship program may submit notice to the chief
administrative officer of the school that the parent or guardian does not wish
to have the student take the elementary assessments prescribed for the
student's grade level under division (A) of section 3301.0710 of the Revised
Code. If a parent or guardian submits an opt-out notice, the school shall not
administer the assessments to that student. This option does not apply to any

public instruction a request for a waiver from administering the elementary
assessments prescribed by division (A) of section 3301.0710 of the Revised
Code. The state superintendent shall approve or disapprove a request for a
waiver submitted under division (K)(1)(c) of this section. No waiver shall be
approved for any school year prior to the 2015-2016 school year.

To be eligible to submit a request for a waiver, a chartered nonpublic

school shall meet the following conditions:

the assessments required by division (A)(1) of section
3301.0710 of the Revised Code shall become public records pursuant to
section 149.43 of the Revised Code on the first thirty-first day of July
following the school year that the assessments were administered.

(2) The department may field test proposed questions with samples of
students to determine the validity, reliability, or appropriateness of questions
for possible inclusion in a future year's assessment. The department also
may use anchor questions on assessments to ensure that different versions of
the same assessment are of comparable difficulty.

Field test questions and anchor questions shall not be considered in
computing scores for individual students. Field test questions and anchor
questions may be included as part of the administration of any assessment

program outside the state. "Dropout" does not include a student who has
departed the country.

(3) "Graduation rate" means the ratio of students receiving a diploma to
the number of students who entered ninth grade four years earlier. Students
who transfer into the district are added to the calculation. Students who
transfer out of the district for reasons other than dropout are subtracted from

(K)(1)(a) and (b) of section 3301.0711,
if as applicable, and section
3313.612 of the Revised Code.

In the course of considering the charter of a new school district created
under section 3311.26 or 3311.38 of the Revised Code, the state board shall
require the party proposing creation of the district to submit to the board a
map, certified by the county auditor of the county in which the proposed
new district is located, showing the boundaries of the proposed new district.
In the case of a proposed new district located in more than one county, the
map shall be certified by the county auditor of each county in which the
proposed district is located.

The state board shall revoke the charter of any school district or school
which fails to meet
the standards for elementary and high schools as
prescribed by the board. The state board shall also revoke the charter of any
nonpublic school that does not comply with division (K)(1)(a) of section
3301.0711, if applicable, and section 3313.612 of the Revised Code.

state board shall be governed by the provisions of Chapter 119. of the
Revised Code.

No school district, or individual school operated by a school district,

shall operate without a charter issued by the state board under this section.

In case a school district charter is revoked pursuant to this section, the
state board may dissolve the school district and transfer its territory to one or
more adjacent districts. An equitable division of the funds, property, and
indebtedness of the school district shall be made by the state board among
the receiving districts. The board of education of a receiving district shall
accept such territory pursuant to the order of the state board. Prior to
dissolving the school district, the state board shall notify the appropriate
educational service center governing board and all adjacent school district
boards of education of its intention to do so. Boards so notified may make
recommendations to the state board regarding the proposed dissolution and
subsequent transfer of territory. Except as provided in section 3301.161 of
the Revised Code, the transfer ordered by the state board shall become

The department of education shall assign weights such that students
who do not take an assessment receive a weight of zero and students who
take an assessment receive progressively larger weights dependent upon the
level of skill attained on the assessment. The department shall assign
additional weights to students who have been permitted to pass over a
subject in accordance with a student acceleration policy adopted under
section 3324.10 of the Revised Code. If such a student attains the proficient
score prescribed under division (A)(2)(c) of section 3301.0710 of the
Revised Code or higher on an assessment, the department shall assign the
student the weight prescribed for the next higher scoring level. If such a
student attains the advanced score, prescribed under division (A)(2)(a) of
section 3301.0710 of the Revised Code, on an assessment, the department
shall assign to the student an additional proportional weight, as approved by
the state board. For each school year that such a student's score is included
in the performance index score and the student attains the proficient score
on an assessment, that additional weight shall be assigned to the student on a
subject-by-subject basis.

Students shall be included in the "performance index score" in

reading. If any other academic field is assessed, the department shall also
include data for students with specific academic ability in that field.

(6) Students in the lowest quintile for achievement statewide, as

determined by a method prescribed by the state board of education.

(C) "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001" includes the statutes codified at
20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq. and any amendments, waivers, or both thereto, rules
and regulations promulgated pursuant to those statutes, guidance documents,
and any other policy directives regarding implementation of that act issued
by the United States department of education.

division (D) of section 3301.0712 of the Revised Code and at least every
sixth year thereafter, upon recommendations of the superintendent of public
instruction, the state board of education shall establish a set of performance
indicators that considered as a unit will be used as one of the performance
categories for the report cards required by section 3302.03 of the Revised
Code. In establishing these indicators, the superintendent shall consider
inclusion of student performance on assessments prescribed under section
3301.0710 or 3301.0712 of the Revised Code, rates of student improvement
on such assessments, the breadth of coursework available within the district,
and other indicators of student success.

Beginning with the report card for the 2014-2015 school year, the
performance indicators shall include an indicator that reflects the level of
services provided to, and the performance of, students identified as gifted
under Chapter 3324. of the Revised Code. The indicator shall include the
performance of students identified as gifted on state assessments and
value-added growth measure disaggregated for students identified as gifted.
For the 2013-2014 school year, except as otherwise provided in this
section, for any indicator based on the percentage of students attaining a
proficient score on the assessments prescribed by divisions (A) and (B)(1) of
section 3301.0710 of the Revised Code, a school district or building shall be
considered to have met the indicator if at least eighty per cent of the tested
students attain a score of proficient or higher on the assessment. A school
district or building shall be considered to have met the indicator for the
assessments prescribed by division (B)(1) of section 3301.0710 of the
Revised Code and only as administered to eleventh grade students, if at least
eighty-five per cent of the tested students attain a score of proficient or
higher on the assessment. Not later than July 1, 2014, the state board may

Sec. 3302.03. Annually, not later than the fifteenth day of September or
the preceding Friday when that day falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the
department of education shall assign a letter grade for overall academic
performance and for each separate performance measure for each school
district, and each school building in a district, in accordance with this
section. The state board shall adopt rules pursuant to Chapter 119. of the
Revised Code to establish performance criteria for each letter grade and
prescribe a method by which the department assigns each letter grade. For a
school building to which any of the performance measures do not apply, due
to grade levels served by the building, the state board shall designate the
performance measures that are applicable to the building and that must be
calculated separately and used to calculate the building's overall grade. The
department shall issue annual report cards reflecting the performance of
each school district, each building within each district, and for the state as a
whole using the performance measures and letter grade system described in
this section. The department shall include on the report card for each district
and each building within each district the most recent two-year trend data in
student achievement for each subject and each grade.

performance measure, whether as an overall measure or as a measure of
separate subgroups, the grades for the measure shall be calculated in the
same manner as prescribed in division (A)(1)(e) of this section.

(f) The value-added progress dimension score for a school district or
building disaggregated for each of the following subgroups: students
identified as gifted,
students with disabilities, and students whose
performance places them in the lowest quintile for achievement on a
statewide basis. Each subgroup shall be a separate graded measure.

Ohioans must be prepared to apply increased knowledge and skills in
the workplace and to adapt their knowledge and skills quickly to meet the
rapidly changing conditions of the twenty-first century. National studies
indicate that all high school graduates need the same academic foundation,
regardless of the opportunities they pursue after graduation. The goal of
Ohio's system of elementary and secondary education is to prepare all
students for and seamlessly connect all students to success in life beyond
high school graduation, regardless of whether the next step is entering the
workforce, beginning an apprenticeship, engaging in post-secondary
training, serving in the military, or pursuing a college degree.

The Ohio core curriculum is requirements for graduation prescribed in
division (C) of this section are the standard expectation for all students
entering ninth grade for the first time at a public or chartered nonpublic high
school on or after July 1, 2010. A student may satisfy this expectation
through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, integrated,
applied, career-technical, and traditional coursework.

Whereas teacher quality is essential for student success in when
completing the Ohio core curriculum requirements for graduation,
the
general assembly shall appropriate funds for strategic initiatives designed to
strengthen schools' capacities to hire and retain highly qualified teachers in
the subject areas required by the curriculum. Such initiatives are expected to
require an investment of $120,000,000 over five years.

Stronger coordination between high schools and institutions of higher
education is necessary to prepare students for more challenging academic
endeavors and to lessen the need for academic remediation in college,
thereby reducing the costs of higher education for Ohio's students, families,
and the state. The state board and the chancellor of the Ohio board of
regents shall develop policies to ensure that only in rare instances will
students who complete the Ohio core curriculum requirements
for
graduation prescribed in division (C) of this section require academic
remediation after high school.

School districts, community schools, and chartered nonpublic schools
shall integrate technology into learning experiences across the curriculum in
order to maximize efficiency, enhance learning, and prepare students for
success in the technology-driven twenty-first century. Districts and schools
shall use distance and web-based course delivery as a method of providing

the school a written statement asserting the parent's, guardian's, or
custodian's consent to the student's graduating without completing the Ohio

Ohio core curriculum those requirements is ineligibility to enroll in most
state universities in Ohio without further coursework.

requirements the school stipulates to ensure the student's and parent's,
guardian's, or custodian's informed consent and to facilitate orderly filing of

school shall notify the department of education of the number of students
who choose to qualify for graduation under division (D) of this section and
the number of students who complete the student's success plan and
graduate from high school.

the plan not

(J) The state board, in consultation with the chancellor, shall adopt a
statewide plan implementing methods for students to earn units of high
school credit based on a demonstration of subject area competency, instead
of or in combination with completing hours of classroom instruction. The
state board shall adopt
later than March 31, 2009, and
commence phasing in the plan during the 2009-2010 school year. The plan
shall include a standard method for recording demonstrated proficiency on
high school transcripts. Each school district and community school shall
comply with the state board's plan adopted under this division and award
units of high school credit in accordance with the plan. The state board may
adopt existing methods for earning high school credit based on a
to the
demonstration of subject area competency as necessary prior
2009-2010 school year.

(K) This division does not apply to students who qualify for graduation
from high school under division (D) or (F) of this section, or to students
pursuing a career-technical instructional track as determined by the school
district board of education or the chartered nonpublic school's governing
authority. Nevertheless, the general assembly encourages such students to
consider enrolling in a fine arts course as an elective.

Beginning with students who enter ninth grade for the first time on or
after July 1, 2010, each student enrolled in a public or chartered nonpublic
high school shall complete two semesters or the equivalent of fine arts to
graduate from high school. The coursework may be completed in any of
grades seven to twelve. Each student who completes a fine arts course in
grade seven or eight may elect to count that course toward the five units of
electives required for graduation under division (C)(8) of this section, if the
course satisfied the requirements of division (G) of this section. In that case,
the high school shall award the student high school credit for the course and
count the course toward the five units required under division (C)(8) of this
section. If the course in grade seven or eight did not satisfy the requirements
of division (G) of this section, the high school shall not award the student
high school credit for the course but shall count the course toward the two
semesters or the equivalent of fine arts required by this division.

(L) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, the board
of education of each school district and the governing authority of each
chartered nonpublic school may adopt a policy to excuse from the high
school physical education requirement each student who, during high

school, has participated in interscholastic athletics, marching band, or
cheerleading for at least two full seasons or in the junior reserve officer
training corps for at least two full school years. If the board or authority
adopts such a policy, the board or authority shall not require the student to
complete any physical education course as a condition to graduate.
However, the student shall be required to complete one-half unit, consisting
of at least sixty hours of instruction, in another course of study. In the case
of a student who has participated in the junior reserve officer training corps
for at least two full school years, credit received for that participation may
be used to satisfy the requirement to complete one-half unit in another
course of study.

(M) It is important that high school students learn and understand
United States history and the governments of both the United States and the
state of Ohio. Therefore, beginning with students who enter ninth grade for
the first time on or after July 1, 2012, the study of American history and
American government required by divisions (B)(6) and (C)(6) of this section
shall include the study of all of the following documents:

non-classroom-based learning opportunities and shall be in compliance with
criteria and documentation requirements for student participation which
shall be established by the department. Any student's instruction time in
non-classroom-based learning opportunities
shall be certified by an
employee of
the community school. A student's enrollment shall be
considered to cease on the date on which any of the following occur:

(a) The community school receives documentation from a parent

terminating enrollment of the student.

subsequent school year. However, if the student without a legitimate excuse
fails to participate in the first one hundred five consecutive hours of learning
opportunities offered to the student in that subsequent school year, the

school year and the department shall recalculate the payments to the school
for that school year to account for the fact that the student is not enrolled.

percentage of full-time equivalency based on the percentage of learning
opportunities offered by the community school to that student, reported

the school's entire school year. However, no internet- or computer-based
community school shall be credited for any time a student spends
participating in learning opportunities beyond ten hours within any period of
twenty-four consecutive hours. Whether it reports hours or days of learning
opportunities, each community school shall offer not less than nine hundred
twenty hours of learning opportunities during the school year.

(4) With respect

to the calculation of full-time equivalency under
division (H)(3) of this section, the department shall waive the number of
hours or days of learning opportunities not offered to a student because the

operation, damage to a school building, or other temporary circumstances
due to utility failure rendering the school building unfit for school use, so
long as the school was actually open for instruction with students in

hours required by this chapter. The department shall treat the school as if it
were open for instruction with students in attendance during the hours or
days waived under this division.

such student in a timely manner or other educational materials or services
have not been provided according to the contract between the individual
community school and its sponsor.

The superintendent of public instruction and the auditor of state shall
jointly establish a method for auditing any community school to which this
division pertains to ensure compliance with this section.

(b) The board or its designee shall conduct an informal hearing on the
matter within thirty days of receipt of such an appeal and shall issue a
decision within fifteen days of the conclusion of the hearing.

instruction grants the student a waiver from the requirement to take the
assessment and a parent is not paying tuition for the student pursuant to
section 3314.26 of the Revised Code. The superintendent may grant a
waiver only for good cause in accordance with rules adopted by the state
board of education.

enroll in special courses organized for veterans for whom tuition is paid
under federal law, or otherwise, the department shall not subtract from a
school district's state aid account and shall not pay to a community school
under division (C) of this section any amount for that veteran.

provider for which a standard early childhood education schedule creates a
hardship or for which the provider shows evidence that the provider is
working in collaboration with a preschool special education program, the
provider may submit a waiver to the Department requesting an alternate
schedule. If the Department approves a waiver for an alternate schedule that

of the federal poverty guidelines, as defined in division (A)(3) of section
5101.46 of the Revised Code, for the early childhood education program.
