II. The committee shall review federal statutes and regulations regarding surveys, questionnaires, tests, and assessments administered by a public school to its students which elicit information about a student’s social behavior, family life, religion, politics, sexual orientation, sexual activity, drug use, or any other information not related to a student’s academics and make recommendations as may be necessary.
