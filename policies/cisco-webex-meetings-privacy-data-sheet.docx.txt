Privacy Data Sheet Cisco Public 

Cisco Webex Meetings 

This Privacy Data Sheet describes the processing of personal data (or personal identifiable information) by Cisco Webex Meetings. 

1. Overview of Cisco Webex Meetings Capabilities 

Cisco Webex Meetings (the “Service” or “Webex Meetings”) is a cloud-based web and video conferencing solution made available by Cisco to companies or persons (“Customers,” “you,” or “your”) who acquire it for use by their authorized users (each, a “user”). The Service enables global employees and virtual teams to collaborate in real time from anywhere, anytime, on mobile devices or video systems as though they were working in the same room. Solutions include meetings, events, training, and support services. For more information regarding the People Insights and Facial Recognition optional features for Cisco Webex Meetings, please see the Addendums below. For a detailed overview of the Service, please visit the Cisco Web Conferencing homepage. 

Because the Service enables collaboration among its users, as described below, your personal data is required in order to use the Service. The following paragraphs describe Cisco’s processing of personal data in connection with the delivery of the Service, the location and transfers of that data, and how it is secured in accordance with privacy principles, laws, and regulations. Cisco will use your personal data consistent with this Privacy Data Sheet to serve the legitimate interests and fulfill the contractual obligations of providing the Solution. Note that this Privacy Data Sheet is a supplement to the Cisco Privacy Statement. 

2. Personal Data Processing 

The Service allows users to instantly connect in a way that is almost as personal as a face-to-face meeting. If you are a user and your employer is the Customer that acquired the Service, your employer serves as the “data controller” for user generated content (see the Webex Meetings Privacy Data Map for a visualization of who is doing what with data). The information described in the table below and in this Privacy Data Sheet is accessible to your employer and is subject to your employer's policies regarding access, use, monitoring, deletion, preservation, and export of information associated with the Service. 

Similarly, if users participate in meetings hosted by users in other companies, the meeting host will control any meeting recordings or files shared during the meeting, which will be subject to the host’s corporate policies regarding access, use, monitoring, deletion, preservation, and export of information. The meeting host has the option to record meetings, which may be shared with others or discoverable in a legal matter. The meeting host should inform all meeting attendees prior to recording and Webex displays a red circle visible to all participants indicating that the meeting is being recorded. Note, Cisco has no control over, and is not responsible or liable for the privacy of any information that you have shared with others. Even after you remove information from the Webex Meetings platform, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others. 

This Privacy Data Sheet covers the Cisco Webex Meetings Suite, Cisco Webex Events, and Cisco Webex Training. If you use the Service together with Cisco Webex Teams, see the see the Cisco Webex Teams Privacy Data Sheet (available on The Cisco Trust Center) for descriptions of the data that may be collected and processed in connection with those services. The table below list the categories of personal data used by the Service and describe why we process such data. 

Personal data processing by the Service does not produce decisions that would result in legal or other significant effects impacting the rights of data subjects based solely by automated means.

7. Personal Data Security 

The Service adopts technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized access use or disclosure. Additional information about our encryption architecture is summarized in the table and paragraphs below. 

Personal Data Category Type of Encryption 

Registration Information (excluding Passwords, discussed below) 

Encrypted in transit, but not at rest 

Passwords Encrypted and hashed in transit and at rest 

Host and Usage Information Encrypted in transit, but not at rest 

User Generated Information Recordings prior to May 2018 were encrypted in transit with the option to encrypt at rest. Recordings 

created after May 2018 are encrypted in transit and at rest by default. Recordings created in the Webex Meetings FedRAMP-Authorized service after October 2019 are encrypted in transit and at rest. 

Protecting Data at Rest The Service encrypts sensitive data at rest. Any data not encrypted at rest is protected by highly-secure data center protection mechanisms and operational procedures. Webex Meetings data centers feature communication infrastructure with industry- leading performance, integration, flexibility, scalability, and availability. 

Version 4.1, May 2020 ©2019 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 

Privacy Data Sheet Cisco Public 

Encryption at Run Time All communications on the Webex Meetings platform occur over encrypted channels. After a session is established, all media streams (audio, VOIP, video, screen share, and document share) are encrypted. The Service then re-encrypts the media stream before sending it to other users. Note that if a Customer allows attendees to join its meetings using third-party video end points, those attendees may be sending your meeting data unencrypted on the Internet. Media streams flowing from a user to Cisco Webex Meetings servers are decrypted after they cross the Cisco firewalls. This enables Cisco to provide network-based recording and SIP-based call support for video end points. 

End-to-End Encryption (Optional) For businesses requiring a higher level of security, the Service also provides end-to-end encryption. With this option, the Service does not decrypt the media streams. In this model, traffic cannot be deciphered by the Cisco Webex Meetings server. The end- to-end encryption option is available for Webex Meetings and Webex Support. Note that when end-to-end encryption is enabled, the following features are not supported: 

• Network-based recordings 

• Join Before Host 

• Cisco Webex Video Platform (formerly known as Collaboration Meeting Rooms Cloud) 

8. Third Party Service Providers (Sub-processors) 

We share Registration Information, Host Information, and/or Usage Information with service providers, contractors or authorized third parties to assist in providing and improving the Service. We do not rent or sell your information. The data shared may include aggregate statistics, de-identified, or pseudonymized data. All sharing of information is carried out consistent with the Cisco Privacy Statement and we contract with third-party service providers that can provide the same level of data protection and information security that you can expect from Cisco. Below is a list of sub-processors for WebEx Meetings.

Addendum One: People Insights feature for Cisco Webex (Optional) 

This Privacy Data Sheet describes the processing of personal data (or personal identifiable information) by the People Insights feature for Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Teams. 

1. Overview of People Insights Capabilities The People Insights feature (“People Insights” or the “Feature”) provides Cisco Webex users with comprehensive, publicly available business and professional information for meeting participants giving users context and increased insight about the people with whom they collaborate. 

Only the Customer’s site administrator has the ability to enable the Feature for their organization and users. Individual users cannot opt-in to use People Insights independently of their site administrator. Users at an enabled organization can opt-out of People Insights by suppressing their profile from other meeting participants’ view. This is accomplished in two ways: 

1. Entering a meeting and selecting the “Hide Profile” link, 2. Signing into people.webex.com and clicking on “Hide Profile” 

2. Personal Data Processing People Insights compiles business and professional profiles for meeting participants using publicly available and legitimately sourced information, published authored works, news articles, search engine results, via APIs and through content supplied by the profile owner.

Obtained through third-party APIs: In accordance with contractual requirements 

Publicly Available Business & Professional Data is derived from public sources. It is retained indefinitely by default. Upon request, publication and links to source data can be suppressed and restricted from view and publication. 

As publicly available data originates from outside of Cisco WebEx, any permanent changes or deletions must be addressed and requested with the primary source. 

At the request of users, the data can be archived in order to not appear. This allows for the data to remain permanently hidden rather than re-appearing with a new search after being previously purged. 

Account Information Active Subscriptions: 

At Customer’s or user’s discretion 

Deactivated Accounts: Deleted within thirty (30) days 

Users can request to remove their Account Information by opening a TAC service request. Cisco will respond to such requests within 30 days. 

Directory Data Active Subscriptions: 

At Customer’s or user’s discretion 

Deactivated Accounts: Deleted within thirty (30) days 

Administrators can disable Active Directory feature while still enabling People Insights. Directory data will be hard deleted in this case of deactivation. Non-directory data will remain, with the exception of name and email for users who had only directory data in their profile before the deactivation. User-Generated Information Active Subscriptions: At Customer’s or 

user’s discretion 

Deactivated Accounts: Deleted within thirty (30) days 

Users can delete User-Generated Information from their profile at any time.

Addendum Two: Facial Recognition feature for Cisco Webex Meetings (Optional) 

This addendum to the Webex Meetings Privacy Data Sheet describes the processing of personal data (or personally identifiable information) by the Facial Recognition feature for Cisco Webex Meetings. 

1. Overview of Facial Recognition Capabilities Cisco introduced the facial recognition feature (“Facial Recognition” or the “Feature”) to provide Webex Meetings users with the ability to identify and recognize registered Webex meeting participants (i.e., associate participant names with their positions in a Webex meeting video), giving users increased connection to meeting participants. The Feature recognizes a face by converting it to an abstracted facial vector. A facial vector is a list of numbers that characterize salient facial features of a user that is then used to identify who is in the meeting. This level of abstraction allows the system to recognize the same face even when things like lighting and position change. 

Facial Recognition is disabled by default, and requires affirmative action by both the customer and the user to enable. First, the administrator for the customer may enable Facial Recognition using Webex Control Hub. However, the feature will not be available on the user’s account until the user opt-ins at https://settings.webex.com. Because the Feature is based on facial vectors derived from profile images, the user must have a picture taken at the time of enablement. 

2. Personal Data Processing If the user opts-in to the Facial Recognition feature, the web page uses the camera of the user’s device to take a profile picture. This picture is sent to the Webex cloud where the Feature algorithm generates a facial vector from the picture so that it can be used for matching as further described below. Both the picture and the facial vector are encrypted and stored securely. The picture may be used to generate a new facial vector in the event Cisco updates or modifies the algorithm by which facial vectors are generated. In the event a customer or user reaches out to Cisco for support with the Feature, Cisco may also use the picture during the troubleshooting process. During each meeting, a second facial vector is generated, then matched in the Webex cloud against the stored facial vector. This second facial vector is not retained. 

The tables below list the personal data used by the Feature and describes why we process that data. 

Personal Data Category Types of Personal Data Purpose of Processing
