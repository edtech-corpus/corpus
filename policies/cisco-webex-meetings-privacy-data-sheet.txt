Privacy Data Sheet 

Cisco Webex Meetings 

 
This Privacy Data Sheet describes the processing of personal data (or personal identifiable information) by Cisco Webex 
Meetings.  
 
1. Overview of Cisco Webex Meetings Capabilities  
 
Cisco Webex Meetings (the “Service” or “Webex Meetings”) is a cloud-based web and video conferencing solution made 
available by Cisco to companies or persons (“Customers,” “you,” or “your”) who acquire it for use by their authorized users 
(each, a “user”). The Service enables global employees and virtual teams to collaborate in real time from anywhere, anytime, 
on mobile devices or video systems as though they were working in the same room. Solutions include meetings, events, 
training, and support services. For more information regarding the People Insights and Facial Recognition optional features for 
Cisco Webex Meetings, please see the Addendums below. For a detailed overview of the Service, please visit the Cisco Web 
Conferencing homepage.  
 
Because the Service enables collaboration among its users, as described below, your personal data is required in order to use 
the Service. The following paragraphs describe Cisco’s processing of personal data in connection with the delivery of the 
Service, the location and transfers of that data, and how it is secured in accordance with privacy principles, laws, and 
regulations. Cisco will use your personal data consistent with this Privacy Data Sheet to serve the legitimate interests and fulfill 
the contractual obligations of providing the Solution. Note that this Privacy Data Sheet is a supplement to the Cisco Privacy 
Statement. 
 
 
2. Personal Data Processing  
 
The Service allows users to instantly connect in a way that is almost as personal as a face-to-face meeting. If you are a user and 
your employer is the Customer that acquired the Service, your employer serves as the “data controller” for user generated 
content (see the Webex Meetings Privacy Data Map for a visualization of who is doing what with data).  The information 
described in the table below and in this Privacy Data Sheet is accessible to your employer and is subject to your employer's 
policies regarding access, use, monitoring, deletion, preservation, and export of information associated with the Service.  
 
Similarly, if users participate in meetings hosted by users in other companies, the meeting host will control any meeting 
recordings or files shared during the meeting, which will be subject to the host’s corporate policies regarding access, use, 
monitoring, deletion, preservation, and export of information. The meeting host has the option to record meetings, which may 
be shared with others or discoverable in a legal matter. The meeting host should inform all meeting attendees prior to 
recording and Webex displays a red circle visible to all participants indicating that the meeting is being recorded. Note, Cisco 
has no control over, and is not responsible or liable for the privacy of any information that you have shared with others. Even 
after you remove information from the Webex Meetings platform, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere 
to the extent it has been shared with others.  
 
This Privacy Data Sheet covers the Cisco Webex Meetings Suite, Cisco Webex Events, and Cisco Webex Training. If you use the 
Service together with Cisco Webex Teams, see the see the Cisco Webex Teams Privacy Data Sheet (available on The Cisco Trust 
Center) for descriptions of the data that may be collected and processed in connection with those services. The table below list 
the categories of personal data used by the Service and describe why we process such data.  
 
Personal data processing by the Service does not produce decisions that would result in legal or other significant effects 
impacting the rights of data subjects based solely by automated means.

Privacy Data Sheet 

Encryption at Run Time 
All communications on the Webex Meetings platform occur over encrypted channels. After a session is established, all media 
streams (audio, VOIP, video, screen share, and document share) are encrypted. The Service then re-encrypts the media stream 
before sending it to other users. Note that if a Customer allows attendees to join its meetings using third-party video end 
points, those attendees may be sending your meeting data unencrypted on the Internet. Media streams flowing from a user to 
Cisco Webex Meetings servers are decrypted after they cross the Cisco firewalls. This enables Cisco to provide network-based 
recording and SIP-based call support for video end points. 
 
End-to-End Encryption (Optional) 
For businesses requiring a higher level of security, the Service also provides end-to-end encryption. With this option, the Service 
does not decrypt the media streams. In this model, traffic cannot be deciphered by the Cisco Webex Meetings server. The end-
to-end encryption option is available for Webex Meetings and Webex Support. Note that when end-to-end encryption is 
enabled, the following features are not supported: 
 

•  Network-based recordings 
• 
• 

Join Before Host 
Cisco Webex Video Platform (formerly known as Collaboration Meeting Rooms Cloud) 

 
 
8. Third Party Service Providers (Sub-processors) 
 
We share Registration Information, Host Information, and/or Usage Information with service providers, contractors or 
authorized third parties to assist in providing and improving the Service. We do not rent or sell your information. The data 
shared may include aggregate statistics, de-identified, or pseudonymized data. All sharing of information is carried out 
consistent with the Cisco Privacy Statement and we contract with third-party service providers that can provide the same level 
of data protection and information security that you can expect from Cisco. Below is a list of sub-processors for WebEx 
Meetings.

9. Information Security Incident Management 
 
Breach and Incident Notification Processes  
Cisco’s Security & Trust Organization coordinates the Data Incident Response Process and manages the enterprise-wide 
response to data-centric incidents. The Incident Commander directs and coordinates Cisco’s response, leveraging diverse teams 
including the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT), the Cisco Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), and 
the Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG).  
 
PSIRT manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of security vulnerabilities related to Cisco products and 
networks. The team works with Customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other 
vendors to identify possible security issues with Cisco products and networks. The Cisco Security Center details the process for 
reporting security incidents.  
 
The Cisco Notification Service allows Customers to subscribe and receive important Cisco product and technology information, 
including Cisco security advisories for critical and high severity security vulnerabilities. This service allows Customers to choose 
the timing of notifications, and the notification delivery method (email message or RSS feed). The level of access is determined 
by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco. If you have questions or concerns about any product or security notifications, 
contact your Cisco sales representative. 
 
10. Certifications and Compliance with Privacy Laws 
 
The Security & Trust Organization and Cisco Legal provide risk and compliance management and consultation services to help 
drive security and regulatory compliance into the design of Cisco products and services. The Service is built with privacy in mind 
and is designed so that it can be used in a manner consistent with global privacy requirements, including the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents 
Act and Personal Health Information Protection Act.  
  
Cisco leverages the following privacy certifications to demonstrate alignment with global privacy frameworks and transfer 
mechanisms related to the lawful use of data across jurisdictions:

11.  How to Exercise Your Data Subject Rights  
 
You have the right to request access, rectification, suspension of processing, or deletion of your personal data processed by the 
Service. 
 
We will ask you to confirm your identification (typically with the email address associated with your Cisco account) before 
responding to your request.  If we cannot comply with your request, we will provide you with an explanation.  Please note, if 
you are a user and your employer is the Customer/Controller, we may redirect you to your employer for a response.

Privacy Data Sheet 

Addendum One: People Insights feature for 
Cisco Webex (Optional) 

 
This Privacy Data Sheet describes the processing of personal data (or personal identifiable information) by the People Insights 
feature for Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Teams.   
 
1. Overview of People Insights Capabilities  
The People Insights feature (“People Insights” or the “Feature”) provides Cisco Webex users with comprehensive, publicly 
available business and professional information for meeting participants giving users context and increased insight about the 
people with whom they collaborate.  
  
Only the Customer’s site administrator has the ability to enable the Feature for their organization and users. Individual users 
cannot opt-in to use People Insights independently of their site administrator. Users at an enabled organization can opt-out of 
People Insights by suppressing their profile from other meeting participants’ view. This is accomplished in two ways:  

 
1. Entering a meeting and selecting the “Hide Profile” link,  
2. Signing into people.webex.com and clicking on “Hide Profile” 

 
2. Personal Data Processing  
People Insights compiles business and professional profiles for meeting participants using publicly available and legitimately 
sourced information, published authored works, news articles, search engine results, via APIs and through content supplied by 
the profile owner. 
 
The tables below list the personal data used by People Insights and describes why we process that data.

Type of Personal Data 

Retention Period 

Criteria for retention 

Publicly Available Business & 
Professional Data 

Obtained from public websites: 
Indefinite 
 
Obtained through third-party APIs: In 
accordance with contractual 
requirements 

Publicly Available Business & Professional Data is derived from public 
sources. It is retained indefinitely by default. Upon request, 
publication and links to source data can be suppressed and restricted 
from view and publication. 
 
As publicly available data originates from outside of Cisco WebEx, any 
permanent changes or deletions must be addressed and requested 
with the primary source. 
 
At the request of users, the data can be archived in order to not

Administrators can disable Active Directory feature while still enabling 
People Insights. Directory data will be hard deleted in this case of 
deactivation. Non-directory data will remain, with the exception of 
name and email for users who had only directory data in their profile 
before the deactivation.  
Users can delete User-Generated Information from their profile at any 
time.

Addendum Two: Facial Recognition feature 
for Cisco Webex Meetings (Optional) 

 
This addendum to the Webex Meetings Privacy Data Sheet describes the processing of personal data (or personally identifiable 
information) by the Facial Recognition feature for Cisco Webex Meetings. 
 
1. Overview of Facial Recognition Capabilities  
Cisco introduced the facial recognition feature (“Facial Recognition” or the “Feature”) to provide Webex Meetings users with 
the ability to identify and recognize registered Webex meeting participants (i.e., associate participant names with their 
positions in a Webex meeting video), giving users increased connection to meeting participants.  The Feature recognizes a face 
by converting it to an abstracted facial vector.  A facial vector is a list of numbers that characterize salient facial features of a 
user that is then used to identify who is in the meeting.  This level of abstraction allows the system to recognize the same face 
even when things like lighting and position change.   
 
Facial Recognition is disabled by default, and requires affirmative action by both the customer and the user to enable.  First, the 
administrator for the customer may enable Facial Recognition using Webex Control Hub.  However, the feature will not be 
available on the user’s account until the user opt-ins at https://settings.webex.com.  Because the Feature is based on facial 
vectors derived from profile images, the user must have a picture taken at the time of enablement.   
 
2. Personal Data Processing  
If the user opts-in to the Facial Recognition feature, the web page uses the camera of the user’s device to take a profile picture.  
This picture is sent to the Webex cloud where the Feature algorithm generates a facial vector from the picture so that it can be 
used for matching as further described below.  Both the picture and the facial vector are encrypted and stored securely.  The 
picture may be used to generate a new facial vector in the event Cisco updates or modifies the algorithm by which facial 
vectors are generated.  In the event a customer or user reaches out to Cisco for support with the Feature, Cisco may also use 
the picture during the troubleshooting process.  During each meeting, a second facial vector is generated, then matched in the 
Webex cloud against the stored facial vector.  This second facial vector is not retained.    
 
The tables below list the personal data used by the Feature and describes why we process that data.
