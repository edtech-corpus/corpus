Privacy and security best practices 

Administrators 

Integrate with Blackboard Learn to securely authenticate your users and to avoid unauthorized users
gate crashing your sessions

Instructors (“Moderators”) 

Review your session material and remove identifying information unless it is required

Remember to switch off notifications and close other applications before sharing your screen

Blackboard Collaborate notifies users when sessions are recorded, but it’s still good practice to also
announce it

You can anonymize chat recordings

Restrict attendee moderator/presenter rights to those who need it when you set up your Collaborate
session

Share guest links mindfully as they are public links. Use the Invite attendee feature to create secure
links that can’t be shared.

Additional best practices can be found on our Help pages

Users (“Participants”) 

Think before you share information about yourself and others in sessions. Particularly when sessions
are recorded.

Mute yourself when not speaking

You can chat privately with others (but remember that the moderators may still supervise those chats)

Follow your institution’s guidelines on the acceptable use of IT tools
