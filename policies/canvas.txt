Last Updated: August 1, 2018

Instructure, Inc. (“INSTRUCTURE”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the personal information that may be collected from users of our websites, including https://www.instructure.com and http://www.canvas.net and any other sites that link to this Privacy Policy (“SITE”), Instructure’s Canvas iOS and Android Applications (“APPS”), and other related educational services (“SERVICES”). By submitting personal information through our Site, Apps, or Services, you expressly consent to the processing of your personal information in the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The use of personal information collected through our service shall be limited to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

FOR EU AND EEA RESIDENTS

Instructure complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (“EU”) and Switzerland to the United States (“U.S.”) respectively, as that term is defined in the Privacy Shield Framework. Instructure has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. Instructure is committed to subjecting all personal data received from the EU and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List: https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.

Instructure’s privacy policy, as provided below, describes the types of personal information that Instructure collects, the types of third parties to which it discloses personal data, and the purposes for which it does so. Instructure collects contact and demographic information to respond to requests or to personalize and deliver the services. Instructure transfers this information to third parties acting as an agent on its behalf. Instructure is accountable for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party. Instructure complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

Residents of the EU and Switzerland have the right to access the personal information that Instructure maintains, and in some cases, may have the right to correct or amend information that is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, to the extent allowed by law. To exercise this right, contact us at privacy@instructure.com. To learn more about the choices you have over your personal information, please see the subsection below entitled, “Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information.”

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Instructure is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Instructure may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Instructure California Privacy Notice

Effective July 1, 2020

This Privacy Notice contains disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and applies only to California residents.

This Privacy Notice describes Instructure’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information as defined in the CCPA, as well as your rights with respect to that personal information. It applies when Instructure is acting as a “business” as defined by the CCPA, for example, when we collect personal information through our corporate websites, and it pertains to and supplements the Instructure Marketing Privacy Policy.

Instructure also processes personal information through our products on behalf of our customers, in order to provide services to our customers. Under the CCPA, when Instructure acts on behalf of its customers, Instructure processes personal information as a “service provider,” a designation which is not subject to the disclosures and rights set forth in this Privacy Notice. To exercise your rights with respect to that personal information, you must contact the relevant Instructure customer—for example, the school you attended or company you worked for when you used an Instructure product. Instructure will cooperate with that business to fulfill your request if they request that we do so. To learn more about how Instructure treats personal information when acting as a service provider, please view the Instructure Product Privacy Policy.

Consumers with disabilities may access this notice by using a screen reader or contacting Instructure for further assistance.
