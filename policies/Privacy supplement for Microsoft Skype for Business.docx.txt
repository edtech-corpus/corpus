Privacy supplement for Microsoft Skype for Business

This page is a supplement to the Privacy Statement for Microsoft Lync Products. In order to understand the data collection and use practices relevant for a particular Microsoft Lync product or service, we recommend you read both the Privacy statement for Microsoft Lync products and this supplement.

This privacy supplement addresses the deployment and use of Microsoft Skype for Business communications software deployed within your enterprise. If you are using Microsoft Lync as part of an online solution or service (in other words, if a third party [for example, Microsoft] is hosting the servers upon which the software runs or connects), information will be transferred to that third party. To learn more about the use of the data being transferred to that third party, please consult your enterprise administrator or your service provider.

	

Archiving

What This Feature Does: Archiving provides organizations that may be subject to retention requirements based on industry or regulatory requirements, or which may have their own organizational retention requirements with a way to archive certain Skype for Business related communications and usage data in support of those requirements.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Archiving stores the content of both peer-to-peer and multiparty instant messages, conference content, including uploaded content (for example, handouts) and event-related content (for example, joining, leaving, uploading, sharing, and changes in visibility) on a server configured by the enterprise administrator. Peer-to-peer file transfers, audio/video for peer-to-peer conversations, application sharing during peer-to-peer conversation, conferencing annotations and polls cannot be archived. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: Allows an organization to archive content to meet industry, regulatory, or organizational retention requirements.

Choice/Control: Archiving is off by default. There are no user-level controls for this feature; the enterprise administrator for the organization manages it.

	

Audio Test Service

What This Feature Does: The Audio Test Service allows the user to check their call quality by making a test call on Skype for Business, which allows the user to hear how they would sound in a real call. When the Check Call Quality button is clicked, the Audio Test Service places a simulated call and prompts the user to record a short, (approximately 5 seconds) voice sample and then plays it back to them. If the network performance is sub-optimal or the user’s device is not set up or configured properly, this will be reflected in the quality of the voice sample.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: A short (approximately 5 seconds) sample of your voice is recorded during the audio test service call. When the Audio Test Service call ends, the voice sample is deleted. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The voice sample is used by you to check and/or verify the sound quality of your Skype for Business call based on the quality of the recording.

Choice/Control: You can check your call quality using the following steps:

In the upper right corner of the Skype for Business main window, click Options (gear icon).


On the Skype for Business - Options dialog box, click Audio Device.


On the Audio Device tab, click the Check Call Quality button, and follow the instructions.


Click OK.


The collection of a voice sample is a requirement for the use of this feature.

	

Call Delegation

What This Feature Does: Call Delegation allows users to assign one or more individuals (delegates) to make or receive calls and set-up or join online meetings on their behalf.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: When assigning delegates, delegate contact information must be provided by the user during the configuration process. Users who are set-up as delegates will receive a notification informing them that someone in their organization has designated them as a delegate. When delegate(s) answer a call on behalf of the person who has assigned them as a delegate, that person will receive an email notification informing them about this event. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: Skype for Business uses the delegate’s contact information to allow them to make or receive calls and schedule or join meetings on behalf of the person to whom they are a delegate.

Choice/Control: Call Delegation is off by default. The enterprise administrator can enable and disable Call Delegation for their organization. If the Call Delegation feature is enabled, users can configure their delegates using the following steps:

In the upper right corner of the Skype for Business main window, click Options (gear icon).


On the Skype for Business - Options dialog box, click Call Forwarding.


Under Call Forwarding, select Forward my calls to or Simultaneously Ring, and then click My Delegates in the drop-down list.


If no delegates are configured, in the Call Forwarding – Delegates dialog, click Add, and then select people to set up as delegates.


Click OK in the Delegates dialog box.


Click OK.


Note:  Enterprise administrators can configure Exchange Calendar Delegate sync-up with Lync Server 2010 or later. When enabled, Exchange Calendar Delegates with appropriate permissions (equal to or greater than Non-editing Author permissions) will be automatically added as delegates in Skype for Business. This however, does not change the Call Forwarding settings.

	

Call Logs

What This Feature Does: Call Logs enables the user to store a record of their Skype for Business voice calls in a Microsoft Outlook folder.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Information about voice calls, such as the start time, end time, duration, and call participants, will be stored in the Outlook Conversation History folder. Meeting subject and location can also be logged by selecting Outlook as the personal information manager on the Personal tab of the Options dialog box.

In the upper right corner of the Skype for Business main window, click Options (gear icon).


On the Skype for Business – Options dialog box, click Personal.


Under Personal information manager, clear the Save call logs in my email Conversation History folder check box.


Click OK.


	

Caller ID in the Meeting Roster

What This Feature Does: Caller ID in the Meeting Roster displays the caller ID of all meeting participants in the meeting roster.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: The caller ID of meeting participants is collected. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: When joining a meeting the participant’s caller ID is displayed in the meeting roster to the other participants.

Choice/Control: There are no end user controls for this feature; the Caller ID is received from the telephone service provider. Some providers allow the ability for users to turn off caller ID. For additional information, please contact your enterprise administrator or your telephone service provider.

	

Client-Side Logging

What This Feature Does: Client-side logging collects information that the second-level support team can use to determine the cause of an issue. Client-Side Logs are stored locally on the user’s computer.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: When Client-Side Logging is enabled specific usage information will be logged and stored on the user’s computer. For example meeting subjects and locations; session initiation protocol (SIP) messages; responses to Skype for Business invites; information about the sender and receiver of instant messages and the route the message took; the users Contact list and presence information; the names of any applications, attachments, Microsoft PowerPoint files, whiteboards, or polls they shared to include any poll questions that were shared and an index of how they voted are all logged in the client-side logs. The contents of Skype for Business conversations are not stored (instant messages, PowerPoint decks, whiteboard contents, notes, poll details, etc.) in the client-side logs. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The information collected in the client-side logs can be used by the user’s customer support or can be sent to Microsoft to troubleshoot Skype for Business issues.

Contact Card

What This Feature Does: The Contact Card displays contact, presence, and location information about you and the people within your organization, in both Skype for Business and recent versions of Outlook. The contact card also provides one-click access to communicate with someone. For example, you can send an instant message, start a call, or send an email message directly from someone’s contact card.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: The static information in the Contact Card is collected from the enterprise’s corporate directory (such as Active Directory). The dynamic information, such as calendar free/busy information is retrieved from Microsoft Exchange Server; location information is retrieved in several ways (see the Location section); telephone numbers can be retrieved from the corporate directory or entered manually by the user; and presence information is managed by Skype for Business using the Outlook Calendar (if enabled by the user) or entered manually by the user. The Lync server shares this information with other people within the organization. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The Contact Card is used to view the contact, location and presence information of people within the users’ organization.

Desktop & Application Sharing

What This Feature Does: Desktop & Application Sharing allows users to collaborate over video chat while also sharing their desktop or selected application with everyone in the meeting enabling them to share and edit files as if they were in the same room as their colleagues. Users can also deliver Microsoft PowerPoint presentations and collaborate with others on a virtual whiteboard, which is a fresh page for notes and drawings that everyone in the meeting can use together. When a user initially shares their desktop or an application, they are the only one in control. If the user chooses, he or she can allow other users to take control of their shared desktop or application, navigate, and make changes using their own mouse and keyboard (see the Desktop & Application Sharing Control section).

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: If sharing is initiated, depending on what is being shared, all conversation participants will be able to see the monitor(s), entire desktop, or selected application on their computer’s screen. No information is sent to Microsoft.

IMPORTANT Documents or pictures that are open on your desktop that are protected by Digital Rights Management (DRM) software may be visible to others with whom you share your desktop in a Skype for Business conversation.

	

Desktop & Application Sharing Control

What This Feature Does: Desktop & Application Sharing Control allows users to grant control of their shared desktop or application to another conversation or meeting participant that is also using Skype for Business on another computer.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Once control is granted, that person can control the shared desktop or application and make changes as if he or she were using the shared computer directly with their keyboard and mouse. The user sharing their desktop or application and the other participants in the Skype for Business conversation or meeting will be able to view these changes as they happen. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Emergency Services (911)

What This Feature Does: When made available by the enterprise administrator Emergency Services allows Skype for Business to transmit a location to a third-party routing service provider selected by the customer. The third-party routing service provider will then transmit the location to the emergency responders when an emergency services number is dialed (such as 911 in the United States). When enabled, the location information transmitted to emergency services personnel is the location that the enterprise administrator has assigned to each user (for example, building and office number) and entered into the location database or, if such a location is not available, the location users may have manually entered in the Location field. If a user dials emergency services while using Skype for Business via a wireless Internet connection, while they are still in their work location, the location information transmitted to emergency responders will be merely an approximate location based on the location assigned to the wireless endpoint with which their computer is communicating. The location information of that wireless endpoint, moreover, is input manually by the enterprise administrator, and therefore, the location information transmitted to the emergency services personnel may not be the user’s actual physical location. To be fully functional this feature requires the enterprise to retain a routing service provided by certified solution providers, and the service is only available within the United States.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: The location information obtained by Skype for Business is determined by the automatic location information populated by the Location Information Server or by the location information manually entered in the Location field by the user. This information is stored in memory on the user’s computer, so when an emergency services number is entered, this location information is transmitted with the call for the purpose of routing to the appropriate emergency services provider and providing their approximate location. Their location may also be sent using an instant message to a local security desk. For emergency calls, the call detail record will contain their location information. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: Location is used for routing the call to the appropriate emergency services provider and for dispatching emergency responders. This information can also be sent to the enterprise's security desk as a notification with the caller’s location and call back information.

Choice/Control: This feature is off by default. The enterprise administrator enables it. Check with your enterprise administrator to determine if this feature is available. There is no ability for you to control whether a location is acquired automatically or transmitted to emergency dispatchers when an emergency call is made.

Note:  The enterprise administrator can restrict the emergency calling capability to your work location, so you should check with your administrator for information about the extent to which the emergency calling functionality is available.

	

Federation

What This Feature Does: Federation allows Skype for Business users within your organization to view presence, send instant messages and place computer-to-computer voice calls (provided that your computer is equipped with speakers and a microphone or a headset) with Skype for Business users from other organizations that you are federated with.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Contact Card information such as name, email address, and presence information is shared between federated contacts. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: Once enabled, users from one organization can add users at another to contact lists, send them instant messages, and see their presence information. Users can choose the best way to communicate for the task—voice, video, and more—and can easily escalate person-to-person sessions to multi-person conferences.

Choice/Control: Federation is off by default and is controlled and configured by the enterprise administrator. If Federation is enabled, users can search for and add federated contacts the same way they would add contacts within their organization.

Note:  By default all external contacts, either personal or federated, will be assigned the External Contacts privacy relationship, which will share your name, title, email address, company, and picture. These contacts will not be able to view your Presence Note. Assigning external contacts to other privacy relationships, for example Work Group, Friends and Family, and so on, will allow them to see your Presence Note and could inadvertently share information that should not be disclosed to them.

	

Location Sharing

What This Feature Does: Location Sharing displays a user’s current geographical location and time zone to other Skype for Business users using the presence functionality of the Contact Card (See the Contact Card section). Users can control what information is shared with others by enabling Privacy Mode in the Options menu. (See the Privacy Mode section).

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: A user’s location is derived in one of two ways. It is collected from the enterprise’s Location Information Server (LIS), which is configured by the enterprise administrator, or the user can manually set their location by entering a custom location into the location control in the Skype for Business user interface, e.g. “Home”, “Work”, or “5678 Main St, Buffalo, NY, 98052”. The time zone is collected directly from the user’s computer operating system. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: Depending on how the user or administrator has configured the privacy settings; location and time zone information is shared by Skype for Business and made available to other users through the Contact Card. The formatted address, or civic address, is not shared over presence.

Choice/Control: If the enterprise administrator has enabled location sharing and configured it to allow users to access full location user interface they will have access to the following items of the location field and menu found at the top of the Skype for Business main window:

Set Location: Location can be manually set by editing the text in the location text box.


Show Others My Location: Allows the user to control whether their location data is shared with other users. This does not affect the sharing of location for emergency services, i.e. calling 911 (see the Emergency Services section).


	

Skype for Business Improvement Program

What This Feature Does: The Skype for Business Improvement Program collects information about your Skype for Business experience and sends it to Microsoft every time you use Skype for Business. Microsoft uses this info to create solutions to common problems and to help improve Skype for Business and other Microsoft products.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: The information sent to Microsoft can include info about how you use Skype for Business, performance and reliability, device configuration, and network connection quality, as well as error codes, error logs, and exception data. The LIP might also send info about you and your device, such as your user name or IP address, but this info is anonymized before it’s stored on Microsoft servers.

Use of Information: The information will be used to create solutions to common problems and to improve Skype for Business and other Microsoft products. The info will not be used identify or contact you.

Choice/Control: This feature is off by default and can be managed by the enterprise administrator. The administrator can choose to always send or never send Skype for Business Improvement information to Microsoft, or allow you to choose your setting.

The user can change their preferences using the following steps:

In the upper right corner of the Skype for Business main window, click Options (gear icon).


On the Skype for Business – Options dialog box, click General.


On the General tab, check or uncheck Send Skype for Business Improvement Program info to Microsoft.


Click OK.


Note: The enterprise administrator can configure this feature on behalf of the users in their organization using a group policy in which case the user will not see the sign-in failure dialog nor will they be asked if they would like to send the sign-in error report to Microsoft.

	

Lync Managed API

What This Feature Does: The Lync Managed API allows third-party programs to access the Skype for Business client and interact with it in a manner that extends the Skype for Business user experience. Third-party programs include programs built by vendors or by Microsoft (for example, Outlook and other applications in the Microsoft Office suites).

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Information made available through the Lync Managed API to third-party applications includes any personal information that is viewable within the Skype for Business user interface. The information could include a user’s location, phone numbers, work title, Contacts list (including phone numbers and other details), personal note, activity state, and current conversations and their contents.

Use of Information: Programs using the Lync Managed API utilize the information within the Skype for Business session to provide enhanced or complementary functionality to the end-user. However, use of this information is at the discretion of the third-party program, which should provide its own privacy statement regarding how it intends to use this information.

Choice/Control: Third-party programs that use Lync Managed APIs fall into three categories: desktop (locally installed) programs; web-hosted programs; and Skype for Business extension programs (programs that are embedded within the Skype for Business conversation window user interface). Controlling third-party access to your information varies for each scenario as follows:

Desktop (locally installed) programs: Desktop programs are installed by you or any administrator of the local computer and will always have access to the user’s information through the Lync Managed API. As always, do not install any programs that you do not trust.


Web-hosted programs: Programs hosted on the Internet or intranet may also be able to access the user’s information through the Lync Managed API. To protect against unwanted programs gaining access to your information without your knowledge, such programs must be hosted from a domain/URL that has been added to your Internet Explorer Trusted Sites list by a local computer administrator.


Skype for Business extension programs: In Skype for Business, developers will be able to extend the Skype for Business experience by embedding a program within the Skype for Business conversation window. This program can also have access to Skype for Business information through the Lync Managed API. In this case, the extension program must have been registered with the Skype for Business client by a local computer administrator. This act of registration also grants the program access to the Lync Managed API.


Special control for Location Name: As an added precaution, your system administrator has the option to allow, block, or allow the end user (you) to decide whether these third-party programs should have access to the Location Name field within Skype for Business. By default, access to location is available to third-party programs. You can control this setting as follows:

In the upper right corner of the Skype for Business main window, click Options (gear icon).


On the Skype for Business – Options dialog box, click Personal.


Under Personal information manager, modify the check boxes as appropriate.


Click OK.


	

Lync VDI Plugin

What This Feature Does: In organizations that use a remote desktop architecture, the Lync VDI Plugin allows both thin and thick clients to connect to Skype for Business and utilize the full set of features and functionality as though they were using directly from their client device.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: When using Skype for Business in remote desktop environments with Lync VDI Plugin installed on the access device, the user’s network logon credentials (i.e. username and password) is collected from the user shared between the VDI plugin and Skype for Business. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The network login credentials collected by the Lync VDI Plugin are used by the plugin to connect the user’s access device to their remote desktop instance of Skype for Business.

Choice/Control: Providing their network logon credentials is required in order to sign in to Skype for Business on their remote desktop. Users are provided with the option to either enter their credentials every time they log in or to enter them one time and save them by choosing the “Save Password” option on the credentials dialog.

	

Meeting Attachments

What This Feature Does: Meeting Attachment allows meeting organizers to upload and share files with meeting participants either by displaying them in the meeting or for download later.

Use of Information: Persistent Group Chat is a persistent chat much like a “chat room” where the conversation never really ends as chat members join and leave the conversation. In order for this to happen the chat must persist.

Choice/Control: Persistent Group Chat must be enabled by the enterprise administrator. If enabled, the administrator can control the retention period, the server on which this information is stored, if Group Chat history is archived for compliance or other purposes, and manage/modify any properties on a room. Users with different roles have different access to the persisted data, as outlined in the following list.

Administrators can delete older content (for example, content posted before a certain date) from any chat room to keep the size of the database from growing greatly. Or, they can remove or replace messages considered inappropriate for a given chat room (or considered unsuitable).


End-users, including message authors, cannot delete content from any chat room.


Chat room managers can disable rooms, but cannot delete rooms. Only administrators can delete a chat room after it is created.

Presence and Contact Information

What This Feature Does: Presence and Contact Information allows a user to view presence and contact information about other users (both inside and outside the organization), and share their own published information such as presence, status, title, phone number, location and notes. The enterprise administrator may also configure integration with Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server so that a user’s out-of-office messages and other status information (for example, when a user has a meeting scheduled in their Outlook calendar) will be displayed.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: The user’s sign-in address and password for login and authentication purposes. Any additional telephone numbers they may want to make available, information such as out-of-office messages and other status information if Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server integration has been configured by the administrator and enabled in Outlook; including any notes or availability that might have been manually by the user is made available in the Contact Card. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: Sign-in address and password are used to log in to Skype for Business and connect to the Lync Server. Based on how the user has configured their privacy settings other Skype for Business users and programs will be able to access the presence, contact, and status information, if published, so users can better communicate with each other.

Choice/Control: Users can choose what information is published about themselves or their enterprise administrator can configure published information on their behalf. If the administrator has not disabled the ability for users to control their published information, they can change their settings at any time using the following steps:

What This Feature Does: Privacy Mode is a setting that allows users to determine how much of their presence information (such as Available, Busy, Do Not Disturb, and so on) they will share with contacts listed in their Contacts list.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Enabling Privacy Mode causes Skype for Business to enter a mode in which a user can adjust user settings so that their presence information is shared only with contacts in their Contacts list. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The setting allows the user to determine how their presence data is shared.

Choice/Control: If the enterprise administrator has enabled Privacy Mode for their enterprise, users can choose whether they want everyone in their organization to see their presence (Standard Mode) or only their contacts (Privacy Mode).

In the upper right corner of the Skype for Business main window, click Options (gear icon).


On the Skype for Business – Options dialog box, click Status.


Under Status, select the desired option.


Click OK


Note:  If the enterprise administrator has enabled Standard Mode for their organization, users will not be able to switch to Privacy Mode. However, they can "pre-opt-out" of Privacy Mode by selecting one of the available options so that if the administrator were to later enable Privacy Mode for the organization, their settings would not be switched upon signing into Skype for Business.

	

Public IM Connectivity (PIC)

What This Feature Does: Public IM Connectivity (PIC) allows Skype for Business users to add users of other public instant messaging (IM) services such as Microsoft Live Messenger so they can communicate quickly and efficiently as well as share their presence and contact information.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Contact Card information such as name, email address, and presence information is shared between PIC contacts. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: Once enabled, users can add their contacts from other public IM service providers to their Skype for Business contact list, send them instant messages, and see their presence information. Users can choose the best way to communicate for the task through voice, video and more, and can easily escalate person-to-person sessions to multi-person conferences.

Choice/Control: Public IM Connectivity (PIC) when enabled by the enterprise administrator can control access to public IM connections on a per-user or per-group basis, select the public IM service providers to which users can connect, and log and archive messages that are sent to users of public IM services.

Note:  By default all external contacts, either personal or federated, will be assigned the External Contacts privacy relationship which will share your name, title, email address, company, and picture. These contacts will not be able to view your Presence Note. Assigning external contacts to other privacy relationships, for example Work Group, Friends and Family, and so on, will allow them to see your Presence Note and could inadvertently share information that should not be disclosed to them.

	

Quality of Experience (QoE) Data Collection and Reporting

What This Feature Does: Quality of Experience (QoE) Data Collection and Reporting collects and reports media quality of peer-to-peer communications and meetings using Skype for Business. These statistics include IP addresses, loss rate, devices used, poor quality events that occurred in the call, and so on.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: If the enterprise administrator enables QoE, media quality data of peer-to-peer communications Skype for Business and meetings are recorded in the QoE database. This capability does not record the content of the Skype for Business. The QoE data is stored in the Monitoring Server backend database deployed in the enterprise and reported in a set of standard Monitoring Server reports. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The enterprise administrator has access to this information and can use it to collect feedback on the quality of media that is flowing in the system. This includes user IP addresses.

Choice/Control: QoE is turned on by default, but the enterprise administrator must install a Monitoring Server, connected to a Monitoring Server backend database, to collect the QoE data. The enterprise administrator can deploy the standard Monitoring Server reports or create custom reports querying the Monitoring Server database.

	

Recording

What This Feature Does: Recording allows meeting participants to capture any audio, video, instant messaging (IM), application sharing, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, whiteboard, and polling that occurs during a meeting for archiving or playback.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: If meeting participants choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on their computer. If participants share content during a meeting that is being recorded, that content will be included in the meeting recording. When a participant starts recording, a notification that a recording has started will broadcast to all participants with compatible clients and devices. Participants in a recorded session who are using incompatible clients or devices will be recorded but will not receive the recording notice. A list of incompatible clients and devices can be found below. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Incompatible clients include:

Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2

Smart Cropping

What This Feature Does: When a user is sharing video during a video conference, Smart Cropping will determine the location of the user’s head within the field of view of their webcam using facial detection. Once the location of the users head is determined, the Skype for Business client translates that into coordinates and adds the coordinates to the video bit stream it is sending. The receiving Skype for Business client uses that information to crop the incoming video bit stream from its native (landscape) aspect ratio according to the rectangle coordinates in order to center the user’s head in the cropped video. Smart Cropping is a real-time function that continuously monitors the user’s movements adjusting the coordinates placed in the video bit stream allowing the receiving Skype for Business client to adjust the video cropping, keeping the users head centered in the video view.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: The coordinates of the user’s head within their cameras field of view is added to the video bit stream. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The coordinates will be used to crop the correct part of the incoming video.

Choice/Control: This feature cannot be disabled.

Note:  Users of legacy Lync clients and Lync for mobile devices will see the full aspect ratio of the video being sent.

	

Tabbed Conversations

What This Feature Does: Tabbed Conversations allows the user view and manage multiple ongoing conversations at once in a tabbed conversation window.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: You can use this feature to view all of your ongoing conversations in single conversation window.

Choice/Control: Tabbed Conversations is off by default and must be turned on by a user.

	

Unified Contact Store

What This Feature Does: The Unified Contact Store consists of three main features:

Search merge – This feature merges the Global Address list (GAL) with a user’s personal Outlook contacts so that, when a user searches for a contact, there will be only a single entry in the search results.


Contact merge – This feature aggregates contact information between Outlook and GAL entries using matching email and/or sign-in identifiers. Once a match is determined, Skype for Business aggregates data from three data sources (Outlook, GAL, and presence). This aggregated data is displayed in various user interface components, including search results, your Contacts list, and a contact card.


Creating Outlook contacts for Skype for Business contacts (contact synchronization) – Skype for Business will create Outlook contacts for all the user’s contacts in the default contacts folder, if the user has a mailbox on Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 or later. By having an Outlook contact for every Skype for Business contact, the user can access Skype for Business contact information from Outlook, Outlook Web Access, and mobile devices that synchronize contacts with Exchange.


Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Skype for Business aggregates contact information from presence, Active Directory, and Outlook. This information is used internally by Skype for Business. When creating Outlook contacts, Skype for Business will be writing presence, Active Directory, and Outlook contact information to Exchange. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: Contact information from Presence, Active Directory, and Outlook are shown in the Skype for Business user interface (Contacts list, contact card, search results, and so on). This information can also be written to Exchange by using contact synchronization (the third item in the preceding list).

Choice/Control: You can enable or disable contact synchronization as follows:

In the upper right corner of the Skype for Business main window, click Options (gear icon).


On the Skype for Business – Options dialog box, click Personal.


Under Personal information manager, modify the check boxes as appropriate.


Click OK.


User option – A user option for Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook is available under Personal information manager, in the Skype for Business - Options dialog box.

	

Voice Quality Improvements

What This Feature Does: Skype for Business provides notifications to the user to help them improve the quality of their call if it detects device, network, or computer issues during the call.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Information about the end user’s audio device setup, network set up and other media connections will be collected by Skype for Business to determine audio quality. If Skype for Business determines that something is adversely impacting audio quality during a voice communication the end user will be informed that there is a voice quality problem. Other call participants are only shown a notification that the end users are using a device that is causing poor audio quality. They do not know what device the end user is using. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The information that is sent to others in the call will help them improve the quality of the call.

Choice/Control: Call quality notifications can be enabled or disabled by the enterprise administrator.

	

Whiteboard Collaboration

What This Feature Does: Whiteboard Collaboration allows users to create and share a virtual whiteboard where session participants can make notes, drawings, and import images to work on together during meetings and conversations.

Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted: Annotations made on whiteboards will be seen by all participants. When saving a whiteboard the whiteboard and all annotations will be stored on the Lync Server. It will be retained on the server according to meeting content expiration policies set by the administrator. No information is sent to Microsoft.

Use of Information: The Whiteboard feature enhances collaboration by enabling meeting participants to discuss ideas, brainstorm, take notes, and so on.

Choice/Control:

From the conversation window, hover over the Share content and lead meeting activities button.


From the Present tab, click Whiteboard.
